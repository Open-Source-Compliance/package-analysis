    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\
    \ to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <yyyy>\
    \ <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\
    \nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\
    \ you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could\
    \ even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should\
    \ also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any,\
    \ to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a\
    \ sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest\

    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\

    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
    you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate
    to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software,
    or if you modify it.


    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
    a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
    sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
    these terms so they know their rights.


    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
    you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
    the software.


    Also, for each author''s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone
    understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software
    is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that
    what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
    will not reflect on the original authors'' reputations.


    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
    to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
    patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we
    have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone''s free use or
    not licensed at all.


    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.


    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
    by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General
    Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
    a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
    under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion
    of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
    this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
    restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute
    a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.


    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as
    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
    keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.


    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
    or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
    these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
    changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
    part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
    as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
    must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
    way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice
    and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)
    and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
    the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
    is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based
    on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
    of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
    independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
    do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
    when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
    whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.


    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
    to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
    control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.


    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
    Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution
    medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.


    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
    2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
    which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
    any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
    source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
    code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
    corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
    distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
    form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
    to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code
    for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
    the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However,
    as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
    that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.


    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
    from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
    parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
    or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
    you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
    or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
    this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
    based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
    and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
    or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
    distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
    not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights
    granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
    to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
    or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
    on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
    of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
    you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
    or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
    circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
    as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.


    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
    other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section
    has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
    system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor
    to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system
    and a licensee cannot impose that choice.


    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence
    of the rest of this License.


    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
    either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder
    who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
    limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
    or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
    spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
    or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
    a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
    you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
    or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
    ever published by the Free Software Foundation.


    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.
    For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
    Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
    will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
    of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY


    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
    PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
    IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
    IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
    PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
    TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs


    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
    to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
    everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.


    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
    them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
    of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
    to where the full notice is found.


    <one line to give the program''s name and an idea of what it does.>

    Copyright (C) <yyyy> <name of author>


    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
    the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
    Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
    WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this
    program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth
    Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.


    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
    starts in an interactive mode:


    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with
    ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w''. This is free software, and
    you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'' for
    details.


    The hypothetical commands `show w'' and `show c'' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
    something other than `show w'' and `show c''; they could even be mouse-clicks
    or menu items--whatever suits your program.


    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
    a sample; alter the names:


    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision''
    (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.


    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice


    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary
    programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
    to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you
    want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.


    NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel services by
    normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use of the kernel, and
    does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work". Also note that the GPL below
    is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, but the instance of code that
    it refers to (the Linux kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote
    it.


    Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel is concerned
    is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever),
    unless explicitly otherwise stated.
