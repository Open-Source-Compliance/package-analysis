    \      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\
    \n      \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n\

    \     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\"\
    \ shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based\
    \ on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions,\
    \ annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n      represent, as a whole,\
    \ an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative\
    \ Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link\
    \ (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works\
    \ thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n\
    \      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n \
    \     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted\
    \ to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an\

    \ systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose\
    \ of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that\
    \ is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright\
    \ owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor\
    \ and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has\

    \n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n \
    \     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n     \
    \ worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright\
    \ license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display,\
    \ publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative\
    \ Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants\
    \ to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,\
    \ irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,\
    \ have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the\
    \ Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n\
    \      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s)\
    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which\
    \ such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation\
    \ against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\
    \ alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work\
    \ constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\
    \ licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
    \      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may\
    \ reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof\
    \ in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object\
    \ form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You\
    \ must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a\
    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\
    \ to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields\

    \ the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined\
    \ below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\"\
    ) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\n\
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe\
    \ purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works\
    \ (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims\
    \ of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute\
    \ as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including\
    \ without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the\

    \ creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution\
    \ for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these\
    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly\
    \ distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of\
    \ CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available\
    \ under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"\
    Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\
    \ not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,\
    \ perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights\
    \ retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and\

    \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi.\
    \ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n    \
    \ European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection\
    \ of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including\
    \ any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar,\
    \ equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable\
    \ law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver.\
    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including\
    \ existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\
    \ all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\n\
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding\
    \ without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"\
    Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public\
    \ at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending\
    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\
    \ termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment\
    \ of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of\
    \ Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\
    \ reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then\
    \ the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the\
    \ Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free,\
    \ non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional\
    \ license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i)\
    \ in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future\
    \ medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including\
    \ without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"\
    License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied\
    \ by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged\
    \ legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity\
    \ or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in\
    \ such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any\
    \ of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert\
    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\
    \ and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\
    \ abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\
    \ b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties\

    \ other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
    \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
    \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\

  extractedText: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright\
    \ © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\"\
    \ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also\
    \ means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\
    \ this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy\
    \ from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n \
    \  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\"\
    \ means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized\
    \ standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming\
    \ language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\
    \n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than\
    \ the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a\
    \ Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves\
    \ only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a\
    \ Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in\
    \ source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential\
    \ component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\
    \ (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the\
    \ work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding\
    \ Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to\
    \ generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify\
    \ the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not\
    \ include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available\
    \ free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which\
    \ are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface\
    \ definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code\
    \ for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\
    \ designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow\
    \ between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding\
    \ Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from\
    \ other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for\
    \ a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n\
    \   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\
    \ on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.\
    \ This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\
    \ Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only\
    \ if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges\
    \ your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\
    \n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\
    \ conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey\
    \ covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications\
    \ exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\
    \ provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material\
    \ for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered\
    \ works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\
    \ control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted\
    \ material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other\
    \ circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing\
    \ is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users'\
    \ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed\
    \ part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling\
    \ obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December\
    \ 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\
    \n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\
    \ rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim\
    \ any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\
    \ against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may\
    \ convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\
    \ medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License\
    \ and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\
    \ keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients\
    \ a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price\
    \ or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You\
    \ may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\
    \ the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) The work must carry\
    \ prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\
    \n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\
    \ this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies\
    \ the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n      c) You\
    \ must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes\
    \ into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\
    \ applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its\
    \ parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission\
    \ to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission\
    \ if you have separately received it.\n\n      d) If the work has interactive\
    \ user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the\
    \ Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,\
    \ your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with\
    \ other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions\
    \ of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger\
    \ program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
    \ \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to\
    \ limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the\
    \ individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not\
    \ cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying\
    \ Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under\
    \ the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\
    \ Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\
    \n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed\
    \ on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\
    \      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\
    \ least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\
    \ support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code\
    \ either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\
    \ that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically\
    \ performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      c) Convey individual copies\
    \ of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding\
    \ Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    \ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\
    \ 6b.\n\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\
    \ place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding\
    \ Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need\
    \ not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object\
    \ code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding\
    \ Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that\
    \ supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions\
    \ next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless\
    \ of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure\
    \ that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n\
    \      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\
    \ inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work\
    \ are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\
    \   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from\
    \ the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\
    \ the object code work.\n\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\"\
    , which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\
    \ family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
    \ into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful\
    \ cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received\
    \ by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of\
    \ that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of\
    \ the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\
    \ to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the\
    \ product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless\
    \ such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \"\
    Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization\
    \ keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions\
    \ of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\
    \ Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning\
    \ of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely\
    \ because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work\
    \ under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,\
    \ and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\
    \ and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or\
    \ for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\
    \ Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\
    \ But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains\
    \ the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,\
    \ the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation\
    \ Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\
    \ warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,\
    \ or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to\
    \ a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely\
    \ affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\
    \ communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation\
    \ Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\
    \ publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source\
    \ code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading\
    \ or copying.\n\n   7. Additional Terms.\n\n   \"Additional permissions\" are\
    \ terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one\
    \ or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the\
    \ entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License,\
    \ to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\
    \ apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those\
    \ permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without\
    \ regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered\
    \ work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy,\
    \ or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their\
    \ own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional\
    \ permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have\
    \ or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other\
    \ provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if\
    \ authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of\
    \ this License with terms:\n\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability\
    \ differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n   \
    \   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\
    \ attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed\
    \ by works containing it; or\n\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the\
    \ origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material\
    \ be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\
    \      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors\
    \ of the material; or\n\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law\
    \ for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      f) Requiring\
    \ indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys\
    \ the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\
    \ to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\
    \ impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional\
    \ terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section\
    \ 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice\
    \ stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further\
    \ restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further\
    \ restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may\
    \ add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document,\
    \ provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\
    \n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must\
    \ place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that\
    \ apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\
    \n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form\
    \ of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify\
    \ a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\
    \ otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under\
    \ the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation\
    \ of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\
    \ (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\
    \ terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails\
    \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after\
    \ the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder\
    \ is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation\
    \ by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\
    \ violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you\
    \ cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n  \
    \ Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\
    \ of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\
    \ your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\
    \ qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\
    \   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to\
    \ accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary\
    \ propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\
    \ nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify\
    \ any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
    \ transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,\
    \ or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of\
    \ a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\
    \ who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\
    \ the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph,\
    \ plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\
    \ predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\
    \ efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of\
    \ the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\
    \ impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\
    \ under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\
    \ making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\
    \ of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who\
    \ authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program\
    \ is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\"\
    .\n\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\
    \ or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\
    \ that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\
    \ using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\
    \ be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\
    \ version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to\
    \ grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\
    \ License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
    \ patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,\
    \ sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents\
    \ of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent\
    \ license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\
    \ enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant\
    \ not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\
    \ party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\
    \ against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on\
    \ a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection\
    \ with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring\
    \ conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
    \ receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey\
    \ a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n  \
    \ A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope\
    \ of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\
    \ of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\
    \n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later\
    \ version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free\
    \ Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\
    \ GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the\
    \ Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide\
    \ which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\
    \ public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose\
    \ that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional\
    \ or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on\
    \ any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later\
    \ version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\
    \ PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\
    \ IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"\
    AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\
    \ ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM\
    \ AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\
    \ THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\
    \ TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\
    \ BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of\
    \ Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
    \ reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\
    \ waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty\
    \ or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a\
    \ fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New\
    \ Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
    \ possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\
    \ software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo\
    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\
    \ to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of\
    \ warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer\
    \ to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\
    \ a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n\
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\
    \nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\
    \ ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\
    \ FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\
    \nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\
    \ this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\nThis is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's\
    \ commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\"\
    .\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\
    \ if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For\
    \ more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\
    \ If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\
    \ of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html>."

    \ 29 June 2007\n\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \n Everyone\
    \ is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document,\
    \ but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n\
    \  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and\
    \ other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical\
    \ works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.\
    \  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your\
    \ freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains\
    \ free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n\
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other\
    \ work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs,\
    \ too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n\
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the\
    \ freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others\
    \ from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore,\
    \ you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,\
    \ or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n\
    \  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or\
    \ for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.\
    \  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that\
    \ use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on\
    \ the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to\
    \ copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.\
    \  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions\
    \ be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously\
    \ to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users\
    \ access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although\
    \ the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim\
    \ of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern\
    \ of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which\
    \ is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this\
    \ version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems\
    \ arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision\
    \ to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom\
    \ of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n\
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on\
    \ general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special\
    \ danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.\
    \  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the\
    \ program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\
    \ and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\
    \  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General\
    \ Public License.\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to\
    \ other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n  \"The Program\" refers\
    \ to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed\
    \ as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\
    \n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n\
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact\
    \ copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work\
    \ or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either\
    \ the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\"\
    \ a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you\
    \ directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright\
    \ law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation\
    \ includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available\
    \ to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\"\
    \ a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or\
    \ receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with\
    \ no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except\
    \ to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n\
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface\
    \ presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item\
    \ in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\"\
    \ for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to\
    \ it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard\
    \ Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined\
    \ by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for\
    \ a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers\
    \ working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work\
    \ include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the\
    \ normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n\
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component,\
    \ or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available\
    \ to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context,\
    \ means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the\
    \ specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a\
    \ compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run\
    \ it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n\
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run\
    \ the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those\
    \ activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose\
    \ tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing\
    \ those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding\
    \ Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\n\
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms\
    \ that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data\
    \ communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of\
    \ the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n\
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n\
    \  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\
    \n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted\
    \ for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the\
    \ stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n\
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered\
    \ work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes\
    \ a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other\
    \ equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate\
    \ covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license\
    \ otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the\
    \ sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide\
    \ you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n\
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control\
    \ copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do\
    \ so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that\
    \ prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their\
    \ relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted\
    \ solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section\
    \ 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention\
    \ Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n\
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the\
    \ WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting\
    \ or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered\
    \ work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures\
    \ to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this\
    \ License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to\
    \ limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\
    \ the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may\
    \ convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any\
    \ medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this\
    \ License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to\
    \ the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give\
    \ all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may\
    \ charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer\
    \ support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source\
    \ Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications\
    \ to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms\
    \ of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a)\
    \ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and\
    \ giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n\
    \    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep\
    \ intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole,\
    \ under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n\
    \    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional\
    \ terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they\
    \ are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in\
    \ any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately\
    \ received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must\
    \ display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n\
    \    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work\
    \ need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate\
    \ and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered\
    \ work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n\
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\"\
    \ if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access\
    \ or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works\
    \ permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License\
    \ to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source\
    \ Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n\
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding\
    \ Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey\
    \ the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical\
    \ distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on\
    \ a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\
    \    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid\
    \ for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts\
    \ or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses\
    \ the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the\
    \ software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n\
    \    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more\
    \ than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source,\
    \ or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at\
    \ no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy\
    \ of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative\
    \ is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received\
    \ the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n \
    \   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place\
    \ (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding\
    \ Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You\
    \ need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with\
    \ the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server,\
    \ the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you\
    \ or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find\
    \ the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding\
    \ Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long\
    \ as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using\
    \ peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object\
    \ code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general\
    \ public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the\
    \ object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as\
    \ a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\
    \n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n\
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household\
    \ purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.\
    \  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall\
    \ be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular\
    \ user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of\
    \ product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which\
    \ the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.\
    \  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n\
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only\
    \ significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for\
    \ a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other\
    \ information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered\
    \ work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.\
    \  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the\
    \ modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n\
    modification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this\
    \ section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\
    \ occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of\
    \ the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed\
    \ term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding\
    \ Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation\
    \ Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third\
    \ party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product\
    \ (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to\
    \ provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue\
    \ to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified\
    \ or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been\
    \ modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification\
    \ itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates\
    \ the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding\
    \ Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this\
    \ section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation\
    \ available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password\
    \ or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"\
    Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense\
    \ by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions\
    \ that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were\
    \ included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable\
    \ law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part\
    \ may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains\
    \ governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n\
    \  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any\
    \ additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional\
    \ permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when\
    \ you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added\
    \ by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright\
    \ permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material\
    \ you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\
    \ of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a)\
    \ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of\
    \ sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified\
    \ reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in\
    \ the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n\
    \    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n   \
    \ requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable\
    \ ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for\
    \ publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\
    \n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade\
    \ names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification\
    \ of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material\
    \ (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability\
    \ to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions\
    \ directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive\
    \ additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning\
    \ of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains\
    \ a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that\
    \ is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document\
    \ contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n\
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that\
    \ license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such\
    \ relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord\
    \ with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement\
    \ of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n\
    where to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,\
    \ may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n\
    the above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not\
    \ propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this\
    \ License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will\
    \ automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent\
    \ licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if\
    \ you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular\
    \ copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright\
    \ holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently,\
    \ if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable\
    \ means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from\
    \ a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder\
    \ notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time\
    \ you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n\
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt\
    \ of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate\
    \ the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n\
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated,\
    \ you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section\
    \ 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required\
    \ to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary\
    \ propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n\
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify\
    \ any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this\
    \ License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n\
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\"\
    \ is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially\
    \ all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.\
    \  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each\
    \ party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n\
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under\
    \ the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source\
    \ of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or\
    \ can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions\
    \ on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For\
    \ example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\
    \ of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n\
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent\
    \ claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing\
    \ the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is\
    \ a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or\
    \ a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the\
    \ contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent\
    \ claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether\
    \ already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,\
    \ permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n\
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further\
    \ modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition,\
    \ \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent\
    \ with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,\
    \ worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent\
    \ claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify\
    \ and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following\
    \ three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment,\
    \ however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission\
    \ to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"\
    grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment\
    \ not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work,\
    \ knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the\
    \ work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms\
    \ of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily\
    \ accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\
    \ be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n\
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent\
    \ with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream\
    \ recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but\
    \ for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your\
    \ recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more\
    \ identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\
    \n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement,\
    \ you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant\
    \ a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing\
    \ them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work,\
    \ then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients\
    \ of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\"\
    \ if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise\
    \ of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that\
    \ are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n\
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business\
    \ of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based\
    \ on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third\
    \ party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from\
    \ you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered\
    \ work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n\
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the\
    \ covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license\
    \ was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed\
    \ as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement\
    \ that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12.\
    \ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether\
    \ by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\
    \ License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you\
    \ cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\
    \ under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\
    \ you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate\
    \ you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n\
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense\
    \ would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the\
    \ GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision\
    \ of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with\
    \ a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\
    \ a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n\
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the\
    \ special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13,\
    \ concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\
    \n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may\
    \ publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a\
    \ certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\n\
    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n\
    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement\
    \ of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version\
    \ for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n\
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or\
    \ copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n\
    \  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE\
    \ EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING\
    \ THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\
    \ WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS\
    \ WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY\
    \ SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO\
    \ EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO\
    \ OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\
    \ ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections\
    \ 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n\
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing\
    \ courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver\
    \ of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or\
    \ assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\
    \n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you\
    \ want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
