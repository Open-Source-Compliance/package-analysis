    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or\
    \ its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute\
    \ the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object\
    \ code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except\
    \ for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n \
    \  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
    \ the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   9.\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to\
    \ Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of\
    \ the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\
    \ pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\
    \nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis\
    \ program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge,\
    \ MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69,\
    \ Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims\
    \ all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers\
    \ to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n<signature of Ty Coon>,\

    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\

    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\

    \ <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\

    \ offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts\
    \ the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.\
    \ However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights\
    \ described in Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any\
    \ Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available\
    \ in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media\
    \ as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism\
    \ to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available\
    \ via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve\
    \ (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\
    \ months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\
    \ available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source\
    \ Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism\
    \ is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\
    \     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file\
    \ documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of\
    \ any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is\
    \ derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\
    \ Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\
    \ Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation\
    \ in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4.\
    \ Intellectual Property Matters\n\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n       \
    \   If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in\
    \ particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you\
    \ must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL''\
    \ which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\
    \ that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after\
    \ You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall\
    \ promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and\
    \ shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\
    \ reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new\
    \ knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If\
    \ Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control\
    \ patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also\
    \ include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n\
    \     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,\
    \ and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe\
    \ recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s),\
    \ You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.\
    \ If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\
    \ to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a\
    \ relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\
    \ You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\
    \ or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,\
    \ You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer\
    \ or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\
    \ liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result\
    \ of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution\
    \ of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable\
    \ form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\
    \ Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the\
    \ Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description\
    \ of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice\
    \ must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related\
    \ documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating\
    \ to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code\
    \ under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this\
    \ License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\
    \ and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or\
    \ alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\
    \ forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\
    \ license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this\
    \ License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\
    \ You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for\
    \ any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result\
    \ of any such terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create\
    \ a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the\
    \ terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In\
    \ such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled\
    \ for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\
    \ respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then\
    \ You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;\
    \ and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\
    \ must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included\
    \ with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\
    \ statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\
    \ recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of\
    \ this License.\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\
    \ attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions\
    \ of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation\
    \ (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time\
    \ to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n   \
    \  6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under\
    \ a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under\
    \ the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\
    \ the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No\
    \ one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\
    \ Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If you\
    \ create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order\
    \ to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License),\
    \ you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'',\
    \ ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\
    \ anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of\
    \ the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\
    \ Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\
    \ Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves\
    \ be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES\
    \ THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\
    \ OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN\
    \ ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME\
    \ THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\
    \ WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED\
    \ CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if\
    \ You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30\
    \ days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which\
    \ are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\
    \ which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\
    \ License shall survive.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES\
    \ AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR\
    \ OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR\
    \ OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR\
    \ ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\
    \ WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL\
    \ DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\
    \ DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\
    \ APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\
    \ EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION\
    \ AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\nThe\
    \ Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.\
    \ 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial\
    \ computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\
    \ (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through\
    \ 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with\
    \ only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\nThis License represents\
    \ the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of\
    \ this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only\
    \ to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed\
    \ by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides\
    \ otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes\
    \ in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered\
    \ to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed\
    \ in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating\
    \ to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,\
    \ with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating\
    \ to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the\
    \ auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement\
    \ shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District\
    \ of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the\
    \ losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs\
    \ and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations\
    \ Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\
    \ Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\
    \ construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY\
    \ FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply\
    \ with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly,\
    \ out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of\
    \ copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing\
    \ such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties\
    \ to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n``The contents\

    \ Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor\
    \ first distributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\nThe\
    \ licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License.\
    \ No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing\
    \ of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above,\
    \ no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor\

    \ the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of\

    \ any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except\
    \ as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\
    \n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result\
    \ of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version\
    \ of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License\
    \ (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\nEach\
    \ Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its\
    \ original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its\
    \ Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\nThis License is not\
    \ intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of\
    \ fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\nSections 3.1,\
    \ 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n\n\
    3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\nAll distribution of Covered\
    \ Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or\
    \ to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform\
    \ recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by\
    \ the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You\
    \ may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
    \ Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\nIf You distribute Covered Software\
    \ in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available\
    \ in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients\
    \ of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\
    \ reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution\
    \ to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the\
    \ terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that\
    \ the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients'\
    \ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a\
    \ Larger Work\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your\
    \ choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License\
    \ for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\
    \ with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software\
    \ is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally\
    \ distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s),\
    \ so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute\
    \ the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\
    \ License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any\
    \ license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of\
    \ warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form\
    \ of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\
    \ extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of\
    \ Additional Terms\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
    \ Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\
    \ of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such\
    \ Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You\
    \ offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of\
    \ liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute\
    \ or Regulation\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\
    \ this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\
    \ judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this\
    \ License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and\
    \ the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included\
    \ with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to\
    \ the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
    \ detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\
    5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\
    \ if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\
    \ then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are\
    \ reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and\
    \ finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor\
    \ fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to\
    \ 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from\
    \ a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\
    \ notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first\
    \ time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\
    \ Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of\
    \ the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting\
    \ a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\
    \ and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly\
    \ infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors\
    \ for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\
    \n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\
    \ license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly\
    \ granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination\
    \ shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\nCovered Software is\
    \ provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind,\
    \ either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties\
    \ that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular\
    \ purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance\
    \ of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective\
    \ in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\
    \ repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\
    \ part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this\
    \ License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\nUnder no\
    \ circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered\
    \ Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,\
    \ incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,\
    \ damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure\
    \ or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such\
    \ party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation\
    \ of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting\
    \ from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\
    \ Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\
    \ consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\
    \n8. Litigation\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in\
    \ the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place\
    \ of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,\
    \ without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section\
    \ shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n\
    9. Miscellaneous\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the\
    \ subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\
    \ such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\
    \ Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\
    \ construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against\
    \ a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\nMozilla\
    \ Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one\
    \ other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions\
    \ of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\
    \n10.2. Effect of New Versions\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under\
    \ the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received\

    \ must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the\
    \ Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n\

    \ the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such\
    \ Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under\
    \ different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does\
    \ not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
    \ Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create\
    \ and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You\
    \ also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software.\
    \ If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed\
    \ by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible\
    \ With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute\
    \ such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that\
    \ the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the\
    \ Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n\
    License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any\
    \ license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of\
    \ warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form\

    \ any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such\
    \ Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms\
    \ You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations\
    \ of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to\

    \ order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License\
    \ to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code\
    \ they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all\
    \ distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent\
    \ prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
    \ detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\
    5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will\
    \ terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However,\
    \ if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a\
    \ particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n\
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing\
    \ basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some\
    \ reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.\
    \ Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing\
    \ basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable\
    \ means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with\
    \ this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days\
    \ after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against\
    \ any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory\
    \ judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor\
    \ Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted\
    \ to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n\
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under\
    \ Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors\
