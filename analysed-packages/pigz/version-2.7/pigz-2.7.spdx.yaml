    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\

    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\

    \  HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout\
    \ the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined\
    \ below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\"\
    ) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\n\
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe\
    \ purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works\
    \ (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims\
    \ of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute\
    \ as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including\
    \ without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the\
    \ Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of\
    \ creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution\
    \ for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these\
    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly\
    \ distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of\
    \ CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available\
    \ under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"\
    Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\
    \ not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,\
    \ perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights\
    \ retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and\
    \ privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in\
    \ a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n\
    \     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting\
    \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi.\
    \ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n    \
    \ European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection\
    \ of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including\
    \ any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar,\
    \ equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable\
    \ law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver.\
    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including\
    \ existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\
    \ all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\n\
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding\
    \ without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"\
    Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public\
    \ at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending\
    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\
    \ termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment\
    \ of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of\
    \ Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\
    \ reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then\
    \ the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the\
    \ Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free,\
    \ non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional\
    \ license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i)\
    \ in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future\
    \ medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including\
    \ without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"\
    License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied\
    \ by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged\
    \ legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity\
    \ or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in\
    \ such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any\
    \ of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert\
    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\
    \ and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\
    \ abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\
    \ b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties\
    \ of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise,\
    \ including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness\
    \ for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or\
    \ other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
    \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
    \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\
    \ disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions\
    \ or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands\
    \ and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document\
