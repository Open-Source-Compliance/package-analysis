                        Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents
                                    Approved November 6, 2008
                               Effective Date: November 10, 2008
1. Background
The IETF Trust was formed on December 15, 2005, for, among other things, the
purpose
of acquiring, holding, maintaining and licensing certain existing and future
intellectual property
used in connection with the Internet standards process and its administration,
for the
advancement of science and technology associated with the Internet and related
technology.
Accordingly, pursuant to RFC 5378, Contributors to the IETF Standards Process
grant the IETF
Trust certain licenses with respect to their IETF Contributions. In RFC 5377,
the IETF
Community has provided the IETF Trust with guidance regarding licenses that the
IETF Trust
should grant to others with respect to such IETF Contributions and IETF
Documents. These
Legal Provisions describe the rights and licenses that the IETF Trust grants to
others with respect
to such IETF Contributions and IETF Documents; as well as certain restrictions,
limitations and
notices relating to IETF Documents. Capitalized terms used in these Legal
Provisions that are
not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in RFC 5378.
2. Applicability of these Legal Provisions.
a. These Legal Provisions are effective as of November 10, 2008 (the “Effective
Date”).
b. The licenses granted by the IETF Trust pursuant to these Legal Provisions
apply
only with respect to (i) IETF Contributions (including Internet-Drafts) that are
submitted to the
IETF following the Effective Date, and (ii) IETF RFCs and other IETF Documents
that are
published after the Effective Date.
c. IETF Contributions made, and IETF Documents published, prior to the Effective
Date (“Pre-Existing IETF Documents”) remain subject to the licensing provisions
of the IETF
copyright policy document in effect at the time of their publication, including
RFCs 1310, 1602,
2026, 3978 and 4748.
d. In most cases, rights to Pre-Existing IETF Documents that are not expressly
granted under these RFCs can only be obtained by requesting such rights directly
from the
document authors. The IETF Trust and the Internet Society do not become involved
in making
such requests to document authors.
e. These Legal Provisions may be amended from time to time by the IETF Trust in
a
manner consistent with the guidance provided by the IETF community and its own
operating
procedures. Any amendment to these Legal Provisions shall be posted for review
at
http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html and shall become effective on a
date specified
by the IETF Trust, but no earlier than thirty (30) days following its posting.
Such amendment
shall apply with respect to all IETF Contributions made and IETF Documents
published
following the effective date of such amendment. All prior versions of these
Legal Provisions
shall continue to be posted at http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html
for reference with
respect to IETF Contributions and IETF Documents as to which they may apply.
3. Licenses to IETF Documents and IETF Contributions.
a. License For Use Within the IETF Standards Process. The IETF Trust hereby
grants to each participant in the IETF Standards Process, to the greatest extent
that it is permitted
to do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all
copyrights and
rights of authors:
i. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF
Documents, in whole or in part, as part of the IETF Standards Process, and
ii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents, in whole or part,
into languages other than English as part of the IETF Standards Process, and
iii. unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained in an IETF
Contribution or IETF Document (as specified in Section 6.b below), to modify or
prepare
derivative works of such IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, in whole or in
part, as part of
the IETF Standards Process.
 b. IETF Standards Process. The term IETF Standards Process has the meaning
assigned to it in RFC 5378. In addition, the IETF Trust interprets the IETF
Standards Process to
include the archiving of IETF Documents in perpetuity for reference in support
of IETF activities
and the implementation of IETF standards and specifications.
 c. Licenses For Use Outside the IETF Standards Process. In addition to the
rights
granted with respect to Code Components described in Section 4 below, the IETF
Trust hereby
grants to each person who wishes to exercise such rights, to the greatest extent
that it is permitted
to do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all
copyrights and
rights of authors:
i. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF
Documents in full and without modification,
ii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents into languages other
than English, and to copy, publish, display and distribute such translated IETF
Contributions and
IETF Documents in full and without modification,
iii. to copy, publish, display and distribute unmodified portions of IETF
Contributions and IETF Documents and translations thereof, provided that:
(x) each such portion is clearly attributed to IETF and identifies the
RFC or other IETF Document or IETF Contribution from which it is taken, 
(y) all IETF legends, legal notices and indications of authorship
contained in the original IETF RFC must also be included where any substantial
portion of the
text of an IETF RFC, and in any event where more than one-fifth of such text, is
reproduced in a
single document or series of related documents.
 d. Licenses that are not Granted. The following licenses are not granted
pursuant to
these Legal Provisions:
i. any license to modify IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, or portions
thereof (other than to make translations or to extract, use and modify Code
Components as
permitted under the licenses granted under Section 4 of these Legal Provisions)
in any context
outside the IETF Standards Process, or
ii. any license to publish, display or distribute IETF Contributions or IETF
Documents, or portions thereof, without the required legends and notices
described in these
Legal Provisions.
 e. Requesting Additional Rights. Anyone who wishes to request license rights
from
the IETF Trust in addition to those granted under these Legal Provisions may
submit such
request to trustees@ietf.org. Such request will be considered by the IETF Trust,
which will
make a decision regarding the request in its sole discretion and inform the
requester of its
disposition. In addition, individual Contributors may be contacted regarding
licenses to their
IETF Contributions. The IETF Trust does not limit the ability of IETF
Contributors to license
their Contributions, so long as those licenses do not affect the rights granted
to the IETF Trust
under RFC 5378.
4. License to Code Components.
a. Definition. IETF Contributions and IETF Documents often include components
intended to be directly processed by a computer (“Code Components”). A list of
common Code
Components can be found at http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html .
b. Identification. Text in IETF Contributions and IETF Documents of the types
identified in Section 4.a above shall constitute “Code Components”. In addition,
any text found
between the markers <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS>, or otherwise clearly labeled
as a
Code Component, shall be considered a “Code Component”.
 c. License. In addition to the licenses granted under Section 3, Code
Components
are also licensed to each person who wishes to receive such a license on the
terms of the "BSD
License", as described below. If a licensee elects to apply the BSD License to a
Code
Component, then the additional licenses and restrictions set forth in Section 3
and elsewhere in
these Legal Provisions shall not apply thereto.

5. License Limitations.
a. No Patent License. The licenses granted under these Legal Provisions shall
not be
deemed to grant any right under any patent, patent application or similar
intellectual property
right.
 b. Supersedure. The terms of any license granted under these Legal Provisions
may
be superseded by a written agreement between the IETF Trust and the licensee
that specifically
references and supersedes the relevant provisions of these Legal Provisions,
except that (i) the
IETF Trust shall in no event be authorized to grant rights with respect to any
Contribution in
excess of those which it has been granted by the Contributor, and (ii) the
rights granted shall not
be less than those otherwise granted under these Legal Provisions.
6. Text To Be Included in IETF Documents. The following text must be included on
the
first page of each IETF Document as specified below:
 a. Submission Compliance for Internet-Drafts. In each Internet-Draft: 
This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions
of BCP 78 and
BCP 79.
 b. Copyright and License Notice. In each IETF Document (including RFCs and
Internet-Drafts):
Copyright (c) [insert year] IETF Trust and the persons identified as the
document authors. All
rights reserved.
This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust’s Legal Provisions
Relating to IETF
Documents (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of
publication of this
document. Please review these documents carefully, as they describe your rights
and restrictions
with respect to this document.
 c. Derivative Works and Publication Limitations. If a Contributor desires to
limit
the right to make modifications and derivative works of an IETF Contribution, or
to limit its
publication, one of the following notices must be included. These notices may
not be used with
any standards-track document, nor with most working group documents.
i. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications, but does wish to
allow publication as an RFC:
This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be
created, except to
format it for publication as an RFC and to translate it into languages other
than English.
ii. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications nor to allow
publication as an RFC:
This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be
created, and it may not
be published except as an Internet-Draft.
7. Terms Applicable to All IETF Documents. The following legal terms apply to
all IETF
Documents:
a. All IETF Documents and the information contained therein are provided on an
"AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHE REPRESENTS
OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THE IETF TRUST AND
THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY THAT
THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY RIGHTS OR
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
b. The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to
the implementation
or use of the technology described in any IETF Document or the extent to which
any license
under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it
has made any
independent effort to identify any such rights. 
c. Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and
any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt
made to obtain a
general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by
implementers or users of
this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
http://www.ietf.org/ipr
.
d. The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
copyrights,
patents or patent applications, or other proprietary rights that may cover
technology that may be
required to implement any standard or specification contained in an IETF
Document. Please
address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
e. The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or under the
auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are published by third
parties,
including those that are translated into other languages, should not be
considered to be definitive
versions of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions is
that published
by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of these Legal Provisions that
are published by
third parties, including those that are translated into other languages, should
not be considered to
be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions.
f. For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards Process
licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of the IETF Standards
Process to the
IETF Trust pursuant to the provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary,
or terms,
conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the rights and
licenses granted under
RFC 5378, shall have any effect and shall be null and void, whether published or
posted by such
Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.

GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you
distribute this file as part of a program that contains a
configuration script generated by Autoconf, you may include it under
the same distribution terms that you use for the rest of that program.
