    \     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\"\
    \ shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based\
    \ on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions,\

    \      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n \
    \     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted\
    \ to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an\

    \ owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor\
    \ and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has\

    \     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n     \

    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which\
    \ such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation\
    \ against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\
    \ alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work\
    \ constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\
    \ licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
    \      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may\
    \ reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof\
    \ in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object\
    \ form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You\
    \ must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a\
    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\
    \ to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields\
    \ enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.\

    \ rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the\

    \ under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary\
    \ for any reason-for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation\
    \ to copyright-then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant\
    \ only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has\
    \ authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\
    \ other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the\
    \ material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes\
    \ be marked or described.\n\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged\
    \ to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\

    \ and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as\
    \ amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere\
    \ in the world.\n\n     m.\tYou means the individual or entity exercising the\
    \ Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\
    \nSection 2 - Scope.\n\n     a.\tLicense grant.\n\n          1. Subject to the\
    \ terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You\
    \ a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license\
    \ to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n           \
    \    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n\n\
    \               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       \
    \   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions\
    \ and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You\
    \ do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n          3. Term. The\
    \ term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n          4. Media\
    \ and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to\
    \ exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter\
    \ created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor\
    \ waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from\
    \ making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\
    \ technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.\
    \ For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized\
    \ by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n          5. Downstream\
    \ recipients.\n\n               A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material.\
    \ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from\
    \ the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions\
    \ of this Public License.\n\n               B. Additional offer from the Licensor\
    \ - Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically\
    \ receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted\
    \ Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n      \
    \         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional\
    \ or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures\
    \ to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights\
    \ by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n          6. No endorsement. Nothing\
    \ in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert\
    \ or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\
    \ with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or\
    \ others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\
    \n     b.\tOther rights.\n\n          1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity,\
    \ are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or\
    \ other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor\
    \ waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the\
    \ limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not\
    \ otherwise.\n\n          2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under\
    \ this Public License.\n\n          3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives\
    \ any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights,\
    \ whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable\
    \ statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\
    \ reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\nSection 3 - License Conditions.\n\
    \nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following\
    \ conditions.\n\n     a.\tAttribution.\n\n          1. If You Share the Licensed\

    \n                    i.\tidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material\
    \ and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested\

    \ the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n                    v.\ta URI or hyperlink\
    \ to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n         \
    \      B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication\
    \ of any previous modifications; and\n\n               C. indicate the Licensed\
    \ Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or\
    \ the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n          2. You may satisfy\
    \ the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,\
    \ means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it\
    \ may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink\
    \ to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n          3. If requested\
    \ by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section\
    \ 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n     b.\tShareAlike.In addition\
    \ to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce,\
    \ the following conditions also apply.\n\n          1. The Adapter's License You\
    \ apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this\
    \ version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n          2. You must include\
    \ the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You\
    \ may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means,\

    \ offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply\
    \ any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise\
    \ of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\nSection 4 -\
    \ Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis\
    \ Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n     a.\t\
    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse,\
    \ reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n\
    \n     b.\tif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents\
    \ in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database\
    \ in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)\
    \ is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n     c.\t\
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial\
    \ portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section\
    \ 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License\
    \ where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection\
    \ 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n     a.\tUnless\
    \ otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the\
    \ Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations\
    \ or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express,\
    \ implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties\
    \ of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,\
    \ absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of\
    \ errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties\
    \ are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\n\
    \     b.\tTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You\
    \ on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise\
    \ for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,\
    \ or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License\
    \ or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the\
    \ possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation\
    \ of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply\
    \ to You.\n\n     c.\tThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,\
    \ most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\
    \nSection 6 - Term and Termination.\n\n     a.\tThis Public License applies for\
    \ the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You\
    \ fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public\
    \ License terminate automatically.\n\n     b.\tWhere Your right to use the Licensed\
    \ Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n          1. automatically\
    \ as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of\
    \ Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n          2. upon express reinstatement\
    \ by the Licensor.\n\n     c.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does\
    \ not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\
    \ of this Public License.\n\n     d.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor\
    \ may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\
    \ distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate\
    \ this Public License.\n\n     e.\tSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination\
    \ of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 - Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n     a.\t\
    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions\

    Section 8 - Interpretation.\n\n     a.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public\
    \ License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict,\

    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the\
    \ Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\
    \ and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer\
    \ of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License\
    \ and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program\
    \ a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your\
    \ copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute\
    \ such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also\
    \ do the following:\n\n     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n     b)\
    \ cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\
    \ in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications,\
    \ to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General\
    \ Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some\
    \ or all third parties, at your option).\n\n     c) If the modified program normally\
    \ reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running\
    \ for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display\
    \ an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that\
    \ there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\
    \ users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user\
    \ how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n\n     d) You may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\
    \ offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another\
    \ independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage\
    \ or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these\
    \ terms.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative\
    \ of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\
    \n     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above;\
    \ or,\n\n     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\
    \ to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution)\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     c) accompany it with\
    \ the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be\
    \ obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and\
    \ only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\
    \nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\
    \ to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code\
    \ for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\
    \ source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating\
    \ system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7.\
    \ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\
    \ General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\
    \ Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"\
    any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED\
    \ FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED\
    \ BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\
    \ AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\
    \ EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES\
    \ OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS\
    \ TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM\
    \ PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\
    \n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\
    \ ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\
    \ THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\
    \ GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE\
    \ OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\
    \ DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR\
    \ A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\
    \ OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF\
    \ TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\
    \nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\
    \ use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\
    \ everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach\
    \ the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start\
    \ of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and\
    \ each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where\
    \ the full notice is found.\n\n     <one line to give the program's name and a\
    \ brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\n     This\
    \ program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the\
    \ terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program\
    \ is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge,\
    \ MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     Gnomovision version\
    \ 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby\
    \ disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to\
    \ direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n\

    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or\
    \ its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute\
    \ the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object\
    \ code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except\
    \ for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n \
    \  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
    \ the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   9.\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to\
    \ Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of\
    \ the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\
    \ pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\
    \nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis\
    \ program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge,\
    \ MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69,\
    \ Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims\

    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\

    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\

    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\

    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\

    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\

    \ License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this\
    \ General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the\
    \ Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered\

    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which\
    \ is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the\
    \ terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n\
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the\
    \ Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n\
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage\
    \ or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this\
    \ License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on\
    \ it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n\
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   \
    \ a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third\
    \ party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source\
    \ distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source\
    \ code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\
    \ medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany\
    \ it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding\
    \ source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution\
    \ and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form\
    \ with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code\
    \ for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to\
    \ it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code\
    \ for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files,\
    \ plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.\
    \  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\n\
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with\
    \ the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system\
    \ on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the\
    \ executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy\
    \ the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code,\
    \ even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the\
    \ object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\
    \ Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept\
    \ this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\
    \ do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n\
    the Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a\
    \ license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\
    \ subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions\
    \ on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a\
    \ consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for\
    \ any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on\
    \ you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions\
    \ of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.\
    \  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\
    \ under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\
    \ you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense\
    \ would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who\
    \ receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could\
    \ satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution\
    \ of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\
    \ under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n\
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\
    \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents\
    \ or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this\
    \ section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software\
    \ distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many\
    \ people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n\
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it\
    \ is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software\
    \ through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis\
    \ section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence\
    \ of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program\
    \ is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\
    \ the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay\
    \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries,\
    \ so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.\
    \  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such\
    \ new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ\
    \ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing\
    \ version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License\
    \ which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following\
    \ the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published\
    \ by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version\
    \ number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program\
    \ into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write\
    \ to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by\
    \ the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n\
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n\
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\
    \ THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\
    \ COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT\
    \ UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS\
    \ PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO\
    \ USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\
    \ HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                  \
    \   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the\
    \ greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and\
    \ a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of\
    \ author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published\

    \    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in\
    \ the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even\

    \ program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin\
    \ Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how\
    \ to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\

    \ the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show\
    \ c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\
    \nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool,\
    \ if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. \

    \ is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification\
    \ of it is not allowed.\n\nPREAMBLE\n========\n\nThe LaTeX Project Public License\
    \ (LPPL) is the primary license under which the the LaTeX kernel and the base\
    \ LaTeX packages are distributed.\n\nYou may use this license for any work of\
    \ which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute. This license\
    \ may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package),\
    \ but you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated to\
    \ TeX.\n\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\
    \ below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are\
    \ considering distributing their works under this license.\n\nThis license gives\
    \ conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions\
    \ under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3\
    \ Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and\
    \ distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical\
    \ specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability\
    \ of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these\
    \ conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the\
    \ base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\nIn this\
    \ license document the following terms are used:\n\n`Work' Any work being distributed\
    \ under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is\
    \ derived from the Work.\n\n`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived\
    \ Work under any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing\
    \ an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a\
    \ file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\
    \n`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\
    \ law. `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another,\
    \ in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any\
    \ electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer protocols such\
    \ as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n\
    \n`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where\
    \ it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using\
    \ installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying\
    \ of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification of any\
    \ installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the\
    \ Work.\n\n`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the\
    \ Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder'\
    \ under any applicable law.\n\n`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is\
    \ normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.\
    \ A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered\
    \ part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies\
    \ itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying\
    \ the license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a \"LaTeX-Format\"\
    .\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\
    \n1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not\
    \ covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act\
    \ of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning\
    \ any offers of support for the Work.\n\n2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified\
    \ copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is\
    \ considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\
    \ Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n\n3. You may distribute\
    \ a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of\
    \ the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work\
    \ is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work\
    \ on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a\
    \ Compiled Work directly from the Work.\n\n4. If you are the Current Maintainer\
    \ of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a\
    \ Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction,\
    \ including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed\
    \ in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions\
    \ of the Work.\n\n5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\
    \ modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\
    \ and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived\
    \ Work.\n\n6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute\
    \ a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component\
    \ of the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that\
    \ it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to\
    \ add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.\n\n     a. If a\
    \ component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of\
    \ the Work when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever\
    \ this component of the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively\
    \ with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly\
    \ and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component\
    \ to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.\n\n     b. Every\
    \ component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature\
    \ of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that\
    \ is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and\
    \ accurate log of the changes.\n\n     c. No information in the Derived Work implies\
    \ that any persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of the original\
    \ version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the\
    \ reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those\
    \ persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived\
    \ Work.\n\n     d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived\
    \ Work:\n\n          1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution\
    \ of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component\
    \ from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from\
    \ the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties\
    \ are not compelled to copy the Work along with the modified component;\n\n  \
    \        2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy\
    \ of the Work.\n\n7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\
    \ distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived\
    \ Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the\
    \ conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.\n\n\
    8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to,\
    \ the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical\
    \ to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is distributed by\
    \ the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\n\n9. Distribution of the Work\
    \ or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived\
    \ Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that\
    \ format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain\
    \ to the results of applying that process.\n\n10.\n     a. A Derived Work may\
    \ be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors\
    \ the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does\
    \ not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\n\n     b. If\
    \ a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that Derived Work must provide\
    \ sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived\
    \ Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the\
    \ Work.\n\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated\
    \ to the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such\
    \ works with the Work by any means.\n\n12. Nothing in this license is intended\
    \ to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable\
    \ laws.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except\
    \ when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as\
    \ is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but\
    \ not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\
    \ particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the\
    \ Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all\
    \ necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by\
    \ applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author\
    \ named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or\
    \ modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including\
    \ any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any\
    \ use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\
    \ to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone\
    \ as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs),\
    \ even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised\
    \ of the possibility of such damages.\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\n\
    \nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly\
    \ and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the\
    \ Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that is `author-maintained'.\n\
    \nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has\
    \ indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the\
    \ Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required\
    \ for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.\n\
    \nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current\
    \ Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot\
    \ be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six\
    \ months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.\n\n\
    You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing\
    \ Current Maintainer to take over this role.\n\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you\
    \ can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps:\n\
    \n     1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright\
    \ Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search.\n\
    \n     2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still\
    \ maintained.\n\n          a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current\
    \ Maintainer to update their communication data within one month.\n\n        \
    \  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance\
    \ is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community\
    \ your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this\
    \ could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\n\n     3a. If the\
    \ Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to\
    \ you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\n\n     b. If the\
    \ Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance\
    \ of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\n\
    \n     4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and\
    \ after three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer\
    \ nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the\
    \ Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\n\n  \
    \   5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once\
    \ more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4),\
    \ then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon\
    \ request provided they then update their communication data within one month.\n\
    \nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that\
    \ the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\n\nIf you become the Current\
    \ Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent\
    \ and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also\
    \ announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.\n\n\
    WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\n\
    \nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations\
    \ for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.\
    \ These authors are addressed as `you' in this section.\n\nChoosing This License\
    \ or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part\
    \ of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly\
    \ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your\
    \ work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use\
    \ the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should\
    \ not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed\
    \ under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution\
    \ explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains,\
    \ for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL)\
    \ was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion\
    \ in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute\
    \ their works under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation\
    \ on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal\
    \ use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified\
    \ component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed,\
    \ often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified\
    \ that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the\
    \ modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\
    \ of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause\
    \ problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to\
    \ keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide\
    \ ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed\
    \ components.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this\
    \ license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright\
    \ notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially\
    \ modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification\
    \ of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere\
    \ is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n     %% pig.dtx\n     %% Copyright\
    \ 2003 M. Y. Name\n     %\n     % This work may be distributed and/or modified\
    \ under the\n     % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version\
    \ 1.3\n     % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n     % The\
    \ latest version of this license is in\n     % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n\
    \     % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n     %\
    \ version 2003/12/01 or later.\n     %\n     % This work has the LPPL maintenance\
    \ status \"maintained\".\n     %\n     % This Current Maintainer of this work\
    \ is M. Y. Name.\n     %\n     % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\
    \ % and the derived file pig.sty.\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file,\
    \ the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\
    \ to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated\
    \ from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any \"\
    LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring\
    \ to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of\
    \ LPPL to apply to your Work, change \"maintained\" above into \"author-maintained\"\
    . However, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as the Maintenance section\
    \ was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community\
    \ even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\n\nImportant Recommendations\n\
    -------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes the Work\n\nThe LPPL requires\
    \ that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore\
    \ important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute\
    \ the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\
    \ files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line\
    \ such as:\n\n      % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\
    \nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible\
    \ for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work\
    \ and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures\
    \ as to which files comprise the Work."

    \nLPPL Version 1.3c 2008-05-04\n\nCopyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project\n\n\
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but\
    \ modification of it is not allowed.\n\nPREAMBLE\n========\n\nThe LaTeX Project\
    \ Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the LaTeX kernel and\
    \ the base LaTeX packages are distributed.\n\nYou may use this license for any\
    \ work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute. This\
    \ license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a\
    \ LaTeX package), but it is written in such a way that you can use it even if\
    \ your work is unrelated to TeX.\n\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE\
    \ WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations\
    \ for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.\n\
    \nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified,\
    \ as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.\n\
    \nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom\
    \ to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever\
    \ technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity,\
    \ and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\
    \ meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex'\
    \ in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\
    \nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n\n`Work' Any work being\
    \ distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable\
    \ law is derived from the Work.\n\n`Modification' Any procedure that produces\
    \ a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example, the production of a\
    \ file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion\
    \ of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into\
    \ another language.\n\n`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived\
    \ Work under any applicable law. `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available\
    \ from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but\
    \ is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\
    \ file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as\
    \ Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n\n`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that\
    \ has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system.\
    \ This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\
    \ transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities.\
    \ Note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes\
    \ modification of the Work.\n\n`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated\
    \ as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is\
    \ the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\n\n`Base Interpreter' A program\
    \ or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the\
    \ whole of the Work.\n\nA Base Interpreter may depend on external components but\
    \ these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external\
    \ component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless\
    \ explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable\
    \ Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the\
    \ `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION\
    \ AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\n1. Activities\
    \ other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this\
    \ license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work\
    \ is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support\
    \ for the Work.\n\n2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work\
    \ as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification\
    \ of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under\
    \ the terms of this clause.\n\n3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has\
    \ been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under\
    \ Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\
    \ the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would\
    \ have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.\n\
    \n4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction,\
    \ modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived\
    \ Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived\
    \ Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are\
    \ considered to be updated versions of the Work.\n\n5. If you are not the Current\
    \ Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating\
    \ a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating\
    \ a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.\n\n6. If you are not the Current\
    \ Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following\
    \ conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly\
    \ states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the\
    \ Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component\
    \ of the Work.\n\n     a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct\
    \ replacement for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\
    \ Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself\
    \ to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement\
    \ component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as\
    \ a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with\
    \ that Base Interpreter.\n\n     b. Every component of the Derived Work contains\
    \ prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or\
    \ a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived\
    \ Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.\n\n     c.\
    \ No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but\
    \ not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any\
    \ support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and handling of errors,\
    \ to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly\
    \ that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n\n     d. You distribute\
    \ at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n\n          1. A complete,\
    \ unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is\
    \ made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place,\
    \ then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar\
    \ place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy\
    \ the Work along with the modified component;\n\n          2. Information that\
    \ is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.\n\n7. If you\
    \ are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work\
    \ generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to\
    \ all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause\
    \ 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.\n\n8. The conditions above\
    \ are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by\
    \ any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version\
    \ of that component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer\
    \ under Clause 4, above.\n\n9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in\
    \ an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part)\
    \ is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\
    \ nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying\
    \ that process.\n\n10.\n     a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different\
    \ license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause\
    \ 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of\
    \ the conditions in this license.\n\n     b. If a Derived Work is distributed\
    \ under a different license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation\
    \ as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the\
    \ restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\n\n11. This\
    \ license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor\
    \ does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the\
    \ Work by any means.\n\n12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be\
    \ used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\n\
    \nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise\
    \ stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty\
    \ of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the\
    \ implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\
    \ The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should\
    \ the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair,\
    \ or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to\
    \ in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components\
    \ of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as\
    \ permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,\
    \ incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out\
    \ of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data\
    \ being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any\
    \ failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright\
    \ Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\n\nThe\
    \ Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and\
    \ prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work\
    \ can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is `author-maintained'.\n\
    \nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has\
    \ indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the\
    \ Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required\
    \ for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.\n\
    \nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current\
    \ Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot\
    \ be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six\
    \ months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.\n\n\
    You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing\
    \ Current Maintainer to take over this role.\n\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you\
    \ can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps:\n\
    \n1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright\
    \ Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search.\n\
    \n2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.\n\
    \n     a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update\
    \ their communication data within one month.\n\n     b. If the search is unsuccessful\
    \ or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer,\
    \ then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance.\
    \ (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to\
    \ comp.text.tex.)\n\n3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to\
    \ pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon\
    \ announcement.\n\nb. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\
    \ Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes\
    \ effect immediately upon announcement.\n\n4. If you make an `intention announcement'\
    \ as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention is challenged\
    \ neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people,\
    \ then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new)\
    \ Current Maintainer.\n\n5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\
    \ reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms\
    \ of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current\
    \ Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within\
    \ one month.\n\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter\
    \ the fact that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\n\nIf you become\
    \ the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the\
    \ Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer.\
    \ You should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as\
    \ in 2b) above.\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\n\
    \nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations\
    \ for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.\
    \ These authors are addressed as `you' in this section.\n\nChoosing This License\
    \ or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part\
    \ of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly\
    \ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your\
    \ work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use\
    \ the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should\
    \ not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed\
    \ under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution\
    \ explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains,\
    \ for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL)\
    \ was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion\
    \ in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute\
    \ their works under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation\
    \ on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal\
    \ use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified\
    \ component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed,\
    \ often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified\
    \ that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the\
    \ modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\
    \ of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause\
    \ problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to\
    \ keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide\
    \ ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed\
    \ components.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this\
    \ license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright\
    \ notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially\
    \ modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification\
    \ of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere\
    \ is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n     %% pig.dtx\n     %% Copyright\
    \ 2005 M. Y. Name\n     %\n     % This work may be distributed and/or modified\
    \ under the\n     % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version\
    \ 1.3\n     % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n     % The\
    \ latest version of this license is in\n     % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n\
    \     % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n     %\
    \ version 2005/12/01 or later.\n     %\n     % This work has the LPPL maintenance\
    \ status `maintained'.\n     %\n     % The Current Maintainer of this work is\
    \ M. Y. Name.\n     %\n     % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\
    \     % and the derived file pig.sty.\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in\
    \ a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the\
    \ `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the\
    \ last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\
    \ referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer'\
    \ referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance\
    \ section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.\
    \ However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section\
    \ was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community\
    \ even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\n\nDerived Works\
    \ That Are Not Replacements\n---------------------------------------\n\nSeveral\
    \ clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the\
    \ user community. They therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived\
    \ Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or incompatible) replacement of\
    \ the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are\
    \ reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\n\
    \nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes\
    \ the Work\n\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\
    \ files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the\
    \ licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example,\
    \ be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright\
    \ notice of each file or by using a line such as:\n\n     % This work consists\
    \ of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an\
    \ unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is\
    \ considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would\
    \ be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work."

    \ in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for\
    \ which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\

    \ of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,\
    \ non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this\

    \ the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of\
    \ the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative\
    \ Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever\
    \ such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are\
    \ for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your\
    \ own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
    \ or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional\
    \ attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add\
    \ Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional\
    \ or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution\
    \ of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided\

    \ the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate\
    \ license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
    \n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\
    \ trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required\
    \ for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
    \ Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES\
    \ OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\

    \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining\
    \ the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks\
    \ associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation\
    \ of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\
    \ negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such\
    \ as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any\
    \ Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
    \ incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of\
    \ this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not\
    \ limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\
    \ malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such\
    \ Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting\
    \ Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative\
    \ Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of\
    \ support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent\
    \ with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
    \ on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other\
    \ Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor\
    \ harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor\
    \ by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND\
    \ OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply this license to your work\n\

    \ and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this\
    \ license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n pig.dtx\n\
    \ Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\n\nThis work may be distributed and/or modified under\

    \ (like the example above) this is interpreted as the latest version of the 1.3\
    \ license, i.e., version 1.3c!\n\nThus we concluded as mentioned in the SDPX-License-Identifier\
