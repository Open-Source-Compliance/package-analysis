    \ by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example\
    \ is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n        \"Derivative Works\" shall mean\
    \ any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from)\
    \ the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or\
    \ other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For\
    \ the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that\
    \ remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
    \ the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n        \"Contribution\" shall mean\

    \ code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on\
    \ behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,\
    \ but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated\
    \ in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n        \"Contributor\"\
    \ shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution\
    \ has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\
    \    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\
    \ License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,\
    \ no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare\
    \ Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute\
    \ the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n    3. Grant of\
    \ Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor\
    \ hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,\
    \ irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have\
    \ made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where\
    \ such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor\
    \ that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination\
    \ of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.\
    \ If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated\
    \ within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then\
    \ any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
    \ as of the date such litigation is filed.\n    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce\
    \ and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,\
    \ with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
    \ meet the following conditions:\n        (a) You must give any other recipients\
    \ of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n        (b) You\
    \ must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed\
    \ the files; and\n        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative\
    \ Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not\
    \ pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n        (d) If the Work includes\
    \ a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works\

    \ contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain\
    \ to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:\
    \ within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within\
    \ the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;\
    \ or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such\
    \ third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for\
    \ informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your\
    \ own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
    \ or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional\
    \ attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n      \
    \  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide\
    \ additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\
    \ or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a\
    \ whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise\
    \ complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n    5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted\
    \ for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and\
    \ conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding\
    \ the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate\
    \ license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
    \    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\
    \ trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required\
    \ for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
    \ Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES\
    \ OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\
    \ any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or\
    \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining\
    \ the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks\
    \ associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n    8. Limitation\
    \ of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\
    \ negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such\
    \ as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any\
    \ Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
    \ incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of\
    \ this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not\
    \ limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\
    \ malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such\
    \ Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n    9. Accepting\
    \ Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative\
    \ Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of\
    \ support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent\
    \ with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
    \ on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other\
    \ Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor\
    \ harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor\
    \ by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND\
    \ OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your\

    \ REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER,\
    \ AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT\
    \ OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\n\
    The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive\
    \ Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent\
    \ owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or\
    \ a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish\
    \ those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative,\
    \ cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and\
    \ without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate\
    \ in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\
    \ and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These\
    \ owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture\
    \ and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to\
    \ gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use\
    \ and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and\
    \ without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\
    \ associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\
    \ is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects\
    \ to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with\
    \ knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning\
    \ and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n    1. Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related\
    \ or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n        i. the right\
    \ to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate\
    \ a Work;\n        ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or\
    \ performer(s);\n        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's\
    \ image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n        iv. rights protecting against\
    \ unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph\
    \ 4(a), below;\n        v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use\
    \ and reuse of data in a Work;\n        vi. database rights (such as those arising\
    \ under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\
    \ March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation\
    \ thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\
    \        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\
    \ world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\
    \    2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\
    \ of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably\
    \ and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known\
    \ or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action),\
    \ in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\
    \ provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\
    \ in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\
    \ purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\
    \ promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit\
    \ of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs\
    \ and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation,\
    \ rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action\
    \ to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by\
    \ Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n    3. Public License Fallback. Should\
    \ any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective\
    \ under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent\
    \ permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition,\
    \ to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\
    \ person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable\
    \ and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\
    \ provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\
    \ in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\
    \ purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\
    \ promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective\
    \ as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\
    \ License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable\
    \ law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\
    \ of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will\
    \ not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in\
    \ the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect\
    \ to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\
    \    4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n        a. No trademark or patent rights\
    \ held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected\
    \ by this document.\n        b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations\
    \ or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\
    \ otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,\
    \ fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent\
    \ or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\
    \        c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\
    \ that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims\
    \ responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights\
    \ required for any use of the Work.\n        d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges\
    \ that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation\
    \ with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work."

    \ of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful\
    \ document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective\
    \ freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher\
    \ a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\
    \ modifications made by others.\n\n    This License is a kind of \"copyleft\"\
    , which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in\
    \ the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\
    \ license designed for free software.\n\n    We have designed this License in\
    \ order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free\
    \ documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms\
    \ that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;\
    \ it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether\
    \ it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\
    \ works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\
    \n    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains\
    \ a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the\
    \ terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license,\
    \ unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.\
    \ The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the\
    \ public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if\
    \ you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under\
    \ copyright law.\n\n    A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work\
    \ containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\
    \ modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n    A \"Secondary\
    \ Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that\
    \ deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the\
    \ Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains\
    \ nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the\
    \ Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\
    \ any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection\
    \ with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical,\
    \ ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n    The \"Invariant Sections\"\
    \ are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of\
    \ Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\
    \ this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then\
    \ it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero\
    \ Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections\
    \ then there are none.\n\n    The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of\
    \ text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice\
    \ that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text\
    \ may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n \
    \   A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented\
    \ in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is\
    \ suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors\
    \ or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)\
    \ some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text\
    \ formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for\
    \ input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\
    \ whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\
    \ subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\
    \ Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"\
    Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\n    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent\
    \ copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\
    \ format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\
    \ simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\
    \ transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\
    \ formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\
    \ or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\
    \ and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\
    \ for output purposes only.\n\n    The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book,\
    \ the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
    \ the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\
    \ formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\
    \ near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\
    \ of the body of the text.\n\n    The \"publisher\" means any person or entity\
    \ that distributes copies of the Document to the public.\n\n    A section \"Entitled\
    \ XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely\
    \ XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another\
    \ language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such\
    \ as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)\
    \ To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means\
    \ that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\n\
    \    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states\
    \ that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered\
    \ to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming\
    \ warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is\
    \ void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n    2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\
    \n    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the\
    \ license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in\
    \ all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this\
    \ License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading\
    \ or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\
    \ compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number\
    \ of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n    You may also\
    \ lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display\
    \ copies.\n    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n    If you publish printed copies (or\
    \ copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering\
    \ more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\
    \ enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\
    \ Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back\
    \ cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\
    \ of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words\
    \ of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\
    \ covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they\
    \ preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\
    \ as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n    If the required texts for either\
    \ cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed\
    \ (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\
    \ adjacent pages.\n\n    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\
    \ numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\
    \ copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network\
    \ location from which the general network-using public has access to download\
    \ using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\
    \ free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably\
    \ prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to\
    \ ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\
    \ location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\
    \ copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\
    \n    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document\
    \ well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance\
    \ to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n    4. MODIFICATIONS\n\
    \n    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\
    \ conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\
    \ Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the\
    \ role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified\
    \ Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things\
    \ in the Modified Version:\n        A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers,\
    \ if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous\
    \ versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\
    \ of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original\
    \ publisher of that version gives permission.\n        B. List on the Title Page,\
    \ as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the\
    \ modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal\
    \ authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than\
    \ five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n        C. State on the\
    \ Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\
    \        D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n        E. Add\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other\
    \ copyright notices.\n        F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices,\
    \ a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under\
    \ the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n      \
    \  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\
    \ required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered\
    \ copy of this License.\n        I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\"\
    , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year,\
    \ new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.\
    \ If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating\
    \ the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title\
    \ Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous\
    \ sentence.\n        J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document\
    \ for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\
    \ locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These\
    \ may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for\
    \ a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or\
    \ if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n  \
    \      K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve\
    \ the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and\
    \ tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\
    \        L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in\
    \ their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered\
    \ part of the section titles.\n        M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\"\
    . Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n        N. Do not\
    \ retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict\
    \ in title with any Invariant Section.\n        O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\
    \n    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices\
    \ that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,\
    \ you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.\
    \ To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified\
    \ Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section\
    \ titles.\n\n    You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it\
    \ contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for\
    \ example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\
    \ organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\n    You may add\
    \ a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to\
    \ 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the\
    \ Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover\
    \ Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the\
    \ Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added\
    \ by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\
    \ you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission\
    \ from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n    The author(s) and\
    \ publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their\
    \ names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\
    \    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n    You may combine the Document with other documents\
    \ released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for\
    \ modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant\
    \ Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as\
    \ Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you\
    \ preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n    The combined work need only\
    \ contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections\
    \ may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections\
    \ with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section\
    \ unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\
    \ author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make\
    \ the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections\
    \ in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n    In the combination, you must\
    \ combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents,\
    \ forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\
    \ \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete\
    \ all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n\
    \    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\
    \ released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License\
    \ in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,\
    \ provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each\
    \ of the documents in all other respects.\n\n    You may extract a single document\
    \ from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided\
    \ you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\
    \ License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\
    \    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n    A compilation of the Document\
    \ or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in\
    \ or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\"\
    \ if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal\
    \ rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When\
    \ the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the\
    \ other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the\
    \ Document.\n\n    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to\
    \ these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\
    \ the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that\
    \ bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers\
    \ if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed\
    \ covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n    8. TRANSLATION\n\n    Translation\
    \ is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of\
    \ the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with\
    \ translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you\
    \ may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\
    \ original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation\
    \ of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty\
    \ Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of\
    \ this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In\
    \ case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this\
    \ License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n  \
    \  If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\"\
    , or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\
    \ will typically require changing the actual title.\n    9. TERMINATION\n\n  \
    \  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\
    \ expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your\
    \ rights under this License.\n\n    However, if you cease all violation of this\
    \ License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\
    \ (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\
    \ terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails\
    \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after\
    \ the cessation.\n\n    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder\
    \ is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation\
    \ by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\
    \ violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you\
    \ cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n  \
    \  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\
    \ of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\
    \ your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of\
    \ a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use\
    \ it.\n    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n    The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\
    \n    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"\
    or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms\
    \ and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that\
    \ has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\
    \ Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any\
    \ version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If\
    \ the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\
    \ License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version\
    \ permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n    11.\
    \ RELICENSING\n\n    \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\"\
    ) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\
    \ provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki\
    \ that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor\
    \ Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable\
    \ works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n    \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative\
    \ Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation,\
    \ a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\
    \ California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by\
    \ that same organization.\n\n    \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish\
    \ a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\n\n    An MMC\
    \ is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if\
    \ all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than\
    \ this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1)\
    \ had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior\
    \ to November 1, 2008.\n\n    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC\
    \ contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August\
    \ 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use\
    \ this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have\
    \ written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following\
    \ copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR\
    \ YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\
    \ under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later\
    \ version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,\
    \ no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included\
    \ in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant\
    \ Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \"with...Texts.\"\
    \ line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with\
    \ the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\
    \nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\
    \ of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your\
    \ document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\
    \ these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such\
    \ as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software."

    Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\
    \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\
    \ document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this\
    \ License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document\
    \ \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to\
    \ copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher\
    \ a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\
    \ modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which\
    \ means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\
    \ sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\
    \ designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use\
    \ it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:\
    \ a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\
    \ software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\
    \ used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published\
    \ as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose\
    \ is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License\
    \ applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this\
    \ License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited\
    \ in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\"\
    , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,\
    \ and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute\
    \ the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified\
    \ Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion\
    \ of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into\
    \ another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter\
    \ section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\
    \ publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or\
    \ to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that\
    \ overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\
    \ a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could\
    \ be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\
    \ or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\
    \ them.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\
    \ are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\
    \ that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\
    \ the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\
    \ Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\
    \ does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover\
    \ Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts\
    \ or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\
    \ this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text\
    \ may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable\
    \ copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\
    \ public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic\
    \ text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\
    \ drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input\
    \ to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable\
    \ for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\
    \ whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\
    \ subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\
    \ Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"\
    Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent\
    \ copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\
    \ format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\
    \ simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\
    \ transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\
    \ formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\
    \ or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\
    \ and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\
    \ for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the\
    \ title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
    \ the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\
    \ formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\
    \ near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\
    \ of the body of the text.\n\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that\
    \ distributes copies of the Document to the public.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\"\
    \ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or\
    \ contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.\
    \ (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\"\
    , \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\"\
    \ of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section\
    \ \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty\
    \ Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the\
    \ Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference\
    \ in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication\
    \ that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning\
    \ of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document\
    \ in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,\
    \ the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\
    \ the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions\
    \ whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct\
    \ or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.\
    \ However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute\
    \ a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section\
    \ 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\
    \ you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish\
    \ printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the\
    \ Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires\
    \ Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\
    \ all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover\
    \ Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\
    \ you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full\
    \ title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\
    \ other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the\
    \ covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\
    \ conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the\
    \ required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should\
    \ put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and\
    \ continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque\
    \ copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\
    \ Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque\
    \ copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public\
    \ has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent\
    \ copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option,\
    \ you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\
    \ copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible\
    \ at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute\
    \ an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition\
    \ to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors\
    \ of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\
    \ them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4.\
    \ MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document\
    \ under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the\
    \ Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling\
    \ the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\
    \ Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\
    \ these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the\
    \ covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of\
    \ previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History\
    \ section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if\
    \ the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title\
    \ Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship\
    \ of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of\
    \ the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has\
    \ fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on\
    \ the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the\
    \ public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License,\
    \ in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice\
    \ the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's\
    \ license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the\
    \ section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating\
    \ at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version\
    \ as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the\
    \ Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the\
    \ Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\
    \ Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location,\
    \ if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the\
    \ Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous\
    \ versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You\
    \ may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years\
    \ before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers\
    \ to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"\
    Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section\
    \ all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or\
    \ dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\
    \ unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent\
    \ are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled\
    \ \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict\
    \ in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\
    \nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\
    \ qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,\
    \ you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.\
    \ To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified\
    \ Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section\
    \ titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\
    \ nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\
    \ statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization\
    \ as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up\
    \ to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover\
    \ Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one\
    \ passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through\
    \ arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover\
    \ text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the\
    \ same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\
    \ replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that\
    \ added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not\
    \ by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert\
    \ or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n\
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,\
    \ under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that\
    \ you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original\
    \ documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined\
    \ work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\
    \nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\
    \ Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple\
    \ Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title\
    \ of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the\
    \ name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a\
    \ unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\
    \ Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination,\
    \ you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents,\
    \ forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\
    \ \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete\
    \ all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou\
    \ may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\
    \ under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the\
    \ various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided\
    \ that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\
    \ documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such\
    \ a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you\
    \ insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License\
    \ in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION\
    \ WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with\
    \ other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage\
    \ or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting\
    \ from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\
    \ users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\
    \ in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate\
    \ which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text\
    \ requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then\
    \ if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's\
    \ Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,\
    \ or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\
    \ Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\
    \n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\
    \ distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\
    \ Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\
    \ copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\
    \ Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You\
    \ may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\
    \ Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original\
    \ English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and\
    \ disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original\
    \ version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\
    \ prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"\
    Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title\
    \ (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\
    \nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\
    \ provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
    \ this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
    \ license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material\
    \ does not give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\
    \nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\
    \ Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\
    \ spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular\
    \ numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\
    \ have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\
    \ version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number\
    \ of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can\
    \ decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Document.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\
    \ Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\
    \ works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.\
    \ A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive\
    \ Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set\
    \ of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means\
    \ the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative\
    \ Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of\
    \ business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of\
    \ that license published by that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means to\
    \ publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\n\
    \nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License,\
    \ and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other\
    \ than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC,\
    \ (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated\
    \ prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC\
    \ contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August\
    \ 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use\
    \ this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have\
    \ written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following\
    \ copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR\
    \ YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\
    \ under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later\
    \ version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,\
    \ no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included\
    \ in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant\
    \ Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \"with...Texts.\"\
    \ line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with\
    \ the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\
    \nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\
    \ of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your\
    \ document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\
    \ these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such\
    \ as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software."

    Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\
    \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\
    \ document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this\
    \ License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document\
    \ \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to\
    \ copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher\
    \ a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\
    \ modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which\
    \ means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\
    \ sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\
    \ designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use\
    \ it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:\
    \ a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\
    \ software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\
    \ used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published\
    \ as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose\
    \ is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License\
    \ applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this\
    \ License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited\
    \ in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\"\
    , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,\
    \ and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute\
    \ the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified\
    \ Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion\
    \ of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into\
    \ another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter\
    \ section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\
    \ publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or\
    \ to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that\
    \ overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\
    \ a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could\
    \ be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\
    \ or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\
    \ them.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\
    \ are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\
    \ that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\
    \ the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\
    \ Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\
    \ does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover\
    \ Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts\
    \ or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\
    \ this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text\
    \ may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable\
    \ copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\
    \ public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic\
    \ text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\
    \ drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input\
    \ to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable\
    \ for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\
    \ whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\
    \ subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\
    \ Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"\
    Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent\
    \ copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\
    \ format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\
    \ simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\
    \ transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\
    \ formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\
    \ or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\
    \ and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\
    \ for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the\
    \ title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
    \ the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\
    \ formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\
    \ near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\
    \ of the body of the text.\n\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that\
    \ distributes copies of the Document to the public.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\"\
    \ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or\
    \ contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.\
    \ (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\"\
    , \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\"\
    \ of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section\
    \ \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty\
    \ Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the\
    \ Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference\
    \ in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication\
    \ that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning\
    \ of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document\
    \ in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,\
    \ the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\
    \ the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions\
    \ whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct\
    \ or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.\
    \ However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute\
    \ a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section\
    \ 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\
    \ you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish\
    \ printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the\
    \ Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires\
    \ Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\
    \ all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover\
    \ Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\
    \ you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full\
    \ title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\
    \ other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the\
    \ covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\
    \ conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the\
    \ required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should\
    \ put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and\
    \ continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque\
    \ copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\
    \ Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque\
    \ copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public\
    \ has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent\
    \ copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option,\
    \ you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\
    \ copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible\
    \ at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute\
    \ an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition\
    \ to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors\
    \ of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\
    \ them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4.\
    \ MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document\
    \ under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the\
    \ Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling\
    \ the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\
    \ Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\
    \ these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the\
    \ covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of\
    \ previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History\
    \ section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if\
    \ the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title\
    \ Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship\
    \ of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of\
    \ the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has\
    \ fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on\
    \ the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the\
    \ public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License,\
    \ in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice\
    \ the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's\
    \ license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the\
    \ section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating\
    \ at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version\
    \ as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the\
    \ Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the\
    \ Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\
    \ Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location,\
    \ if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the\
    \ Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous\
    \ versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You\
    \ may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years\
    \ before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers\
    \ to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"\
    Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section\
    \ all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or\
    \ dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\
    \ unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent\
    \ are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled\
    \ \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict\
    \ in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\
    \nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\
    \ qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,\
    \ you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.\
    \ To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified\
    \ Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section\
    \ titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\
    \ nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\
    \ statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization\
    \ as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up\
    \ to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover\
    \ Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one\
    \ passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through\
    \ arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover\
    \ text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the\
    \ same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\
    \ replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that\
    \ added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not\
    \ by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert\
    \ or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n\
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,\
    \ under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that\
    \ you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original\
    \ documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined\
    \ work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\
    \nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\
    \ Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple\
    \ Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title\
    \ of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the\
    \ name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a\
    \ unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\
    \ Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination,\
    \ you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents,\
    \ forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\
    \ \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete\
    \ all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou\
    \ may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\
    \ under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the\
    \ various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided\
    \ that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\
    \ documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such\
    \ a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you\
    \ insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License\
    \ in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION\
    \ WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with\
    \ other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage\
    \ or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting\
    \ from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\
    \ users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\
    \ in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate\
    \ which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text\
    \ requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then\
    \ if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's\
    \ Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,\
    \ or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\
    \ Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\
    \n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\
    \ distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\
    \ Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\
    \ copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\
    \ Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You\
    \ may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\
    \ Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original\
    \ English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and\
    \ disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original\
    \ version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\
    \ prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"\
    Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title\
    \ (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\
    \nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\
    \ provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
    \ this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
    \ license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material\
    \ does not give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\
    \nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\
    \ Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\
    \ spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular\
    \ numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\
    \ have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\
    \ version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number\
    \ of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can\
    \ decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Document.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\
    \ Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\
    \ works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.\
    \ A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive\
    \ Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set\
    \ of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means\
    \ the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative\
    \ Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of\
    \ business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of\
    \ that license published by that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means to\
    \ publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\n\
    \nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License,\
    \ and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other\
    \ than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC,\
    \ (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated\
    \ prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC\
    \ contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August\
    \ 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use\
    \ this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have\
    \ written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following\
    \ copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR\
    \ YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\
    \ under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later\
    \ version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,\
    \ no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included\
    \ in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant\
    \ Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \"with...Texts.\"\
    \ line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with\
    \ the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\
    \nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\
    \ of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your\
    \ document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\
    \ these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such\
    \ as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software."

    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n    0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n        a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n        b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n        d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n    Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program\
    \ (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not\
    \ bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n    3. You may copy and\
    \ distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2)\
    \ in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above\
    \ provided that you also do one of the following:\n        a) accompany it with\
    \ the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n        b) accompany it with\
    \ a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free\
    \ (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n        c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n    Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n    4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n    5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n    6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n   \
    \ 7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\
    \ General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \    8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n    NO WARRANTY\n    9.\n\n    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n    10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms\
    \ to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be\
    \ of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to\
    \ make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\
    \ terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\
    \ to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\
    \ exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\"\
    \ line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the\
    \ program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name\
    \ of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later\
    \ version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\
    \ but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact\
    \ you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it\
    \ output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision\
    \ version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY\
    \ NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome\
    \ to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n\
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts\
    \ of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called\
    \ something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks\
    \ or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer\
    \ (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright\
    \ disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\
    \nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision'\
    \ (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James\
    \ Hacker.\n\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\

    \ © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    0. Definitions.\n\n    \"This License\"\
    \ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n    \"Copyright\"\
    \ also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n    \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\
    \ this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\n    To \"modify\" a work means to copy\
    \ from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n \
    \   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\
    \ the Program.\n\n    To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that,\
    \ without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\
    \ under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying\
    \ a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without\
    \ modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities\
    \ as well.\n\n    To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables\
    \ other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\
    \ a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n    An\
    \ interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent\
    \ that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty\
    \ for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees\
    \ may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,\
    \ a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n    1. Source Code.\n  \
    \  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n\
    \    A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard\
    \ defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified\
    \ for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\
    \ working in that language.\n\n    The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work\
    \ include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the\
    \ normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\
    \ Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component,\
    \ or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available\
    \ to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means\
    \ a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific\
    \ operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used\
    \ to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n    The\
    \ \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source\
    \ code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\
    \ code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.\
    \ However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose\
    \ tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing\
    \ those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding\
    \ Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for\
    \ the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms\
    \ that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\
    \ communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the\
    \ work.\n\n    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\
    \ regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n \
    \   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\
    \    2. Basic Permissions.\n    All rights granted under this License are granted\
    \ for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\
    \ conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission\
    \ to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered\
    \ by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered\
    \ work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,\
    \ as provided by copyright law.\n\n    You may make, run and propagate covered\
    \ works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise\
    \ remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\
    \ of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities\
    \ for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License\
    \ in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus\
    \ making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\
    \ under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any\
    \ copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n\
    \    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\
    \ stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\
    \    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n    No covered\
    \ work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable\
    \ law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted\
    \ on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\
    \ of such measures.\n\n    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal\
    \ power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\
    \ is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered\
    \ work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the\
    \ work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'\
    \ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n    4. Conveying\
    \ Verbatim Copies.\n    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source\
    \ code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices\
    \ stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with\
    \ section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n \
    \   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you\
    \ may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n    5. Conveying Modified\
    \ Source Versions.\n    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications\
    \ to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of\
    \ section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n        a)\
    \ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving\
    \ a relevant date.\n        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that\
    \ it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.\
    \ This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all\
    \ notices\".\n        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\
    \ License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore\
    \ apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of\
    \ the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License\
    \ gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate\
    \ such permission if you have separately received it.\n        d) If the work\
    \ has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;\
    \ however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate\
    \ Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n    A compilation of a\
    \ covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their\
    \ nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such\
    \ as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\
    \ medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright\
    \ are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\
    \ beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\
    \ does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\
    \    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n    You may convey a covered work in object\
    \ code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey\
    \ the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in\
    \ one of these ways:\n        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a\
    \ physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by\
    \ the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange.\n        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\
    \ by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as\
    \ you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone\
    \ who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source\
    \ for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable\
    \ physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more\
    \ than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\
    \ or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\
    \        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\
    \ offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\
    \ occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with\
    \ such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n        d) Convey the object code\
    \ by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer\
    \ equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same\
    \ place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a\
    \ network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated\
    \ by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    \ Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\
    \ you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\
    \ satisfy these requirements.\n        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\
    \ subsection 6d.\n\n    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code\
    \ is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\
    \ in conveying the object code work.\n\n    A \"User Product\" is either (1) a\
    \ \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally\
    \ used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or\
    \ sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is\
    \ a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For\
    \ a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers\
    \ to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
    \ of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\
    \ or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product\
    \ regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\
    \ non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use\
    \ of the product.\n\n    \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means\
    \ any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\
    \ install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product\
    \ from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice\
    \ to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no\
    \ case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\
    \n    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically\
    \ for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction\
    \ in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\
    \ to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\
    \ is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must\
    \ be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not\
    \ apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\
    \ object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\
    \ ROM).\n\n    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\
    \ a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for\
    \ a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\
    \ Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
    \ be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\
    \ operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\
    \ across the network.\n\n    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\
    \ provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\
    \ (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and\
    \ must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\
    \    7. Additional Terms.\n    \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement\
    \ the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    \n    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove\
    \ any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\
    \ permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when\
    \ you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added\
    \ by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\
    \ permission.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for\
    \ material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright\
    \ holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\
    \        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms\
    \ of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n        b) Requiring preservation\
    \ of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material\
    \ or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n \
    \       c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring\
    \ that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different\
    \ from the original version; or\n        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes\
    \ of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n        e) Declining to\
    \ grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or\
    \ service marks; or\n        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors\
    \ of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\
    \ it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability\
    \ that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\
    \n    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\"\
    \ within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any\
    \ part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along\
    \ with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\
    \ document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\
    \ under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\
    \ of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive\
    \ such relicensing or conveying.\n\n    If you add terms to a covered work in\
    \ accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement\
    \ of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where\
    \ to find the applicable terms.\n\n    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,\
    \ may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\
    \ the above requirements apply either way.\n    8. Termination.\n    You may not\
    \ propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.\
    \ Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted\
    \ under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n    However, if you cease all violation\
    \ of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\
    \ (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\
    \ terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails\
    \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after\
    \ the cessation.\n\n    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder\
    \ is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation\
    \ by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\
    \ violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you\
    \ cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n  \
    \  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\
    \ of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\
    \ your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\
    \ qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n  \
    \  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n    You are not required to\
    \ accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary\
    \ propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\
    \ nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify\
    \ any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so.\n    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties with this License.\n\n    An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
    \ transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,\
    \ or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of\
    \ a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\
    \ who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\
    \ the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph,\
    \ plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\
    \ predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\
    \ efforts.\n\n    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise\
    \ of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\
    \ impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\
    \ under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\
    \ making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\
    \ of it.\n    11. Patents.\n    A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes\
    \ use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.\
    \ The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\
    \n    A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\
    \ or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\
    \ that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\
    \ using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\
    \ be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\
    \ version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to\
    \ grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\
    \ License.\n\n    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
    \ patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,\
    \ sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents\
    \ of its contributor version.\n\n    In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent\
    \ license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\
    \ enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant\
    \ not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\
    \ party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\
    \ against the party.\n\n    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on\
    \ a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n    If, pursuant to or in connection\
    \ with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring\
    \ conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
    \ receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey\
    \ a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n  \
    \  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope\
    \ of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\
    \ of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \n    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\
    \ implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available\
    \ to you under applicable patent law.\n    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\
    \    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n    Notwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n    14. Revised Versions of this License.\n    The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain\
    \ numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\n    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
    \ versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Program.\n\n    Later license versions may give you additional\
    \ or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on\
    \ any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later\
    \ version.\n    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\
    \ PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\
    \ IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"\
    AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n    16. Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\
    \ ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM\
    \ AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\
    \ THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\
    \ TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\
    \ BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n    17. Interpretation of\
    \ Sections 15 and 16.\n\n    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
    \ reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\
    \ waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty\
    \ or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a\
    \ fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New\
    \ Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
    \ possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\
    \ software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo\
    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\
    \ to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of\
    \ warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer\
    \ to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\
    \ a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis\
    \ program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the\
    \ terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n\
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\
    \ WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\

  extractedText: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright\
    \ © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    0. Definitions.\n\n    \"This License\"\
    \ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n    \"Copyright\"\
    \ also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n    \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\
    \ this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\n    To \"modify\" a work means to copy\
    \ from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n \
    \   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\
    \ the Program.\n\n    To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that,\
    \ without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\
    \ under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying\
    \ a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without\
    \ modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities\
    \ as well.\n\n    To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables\
    \ other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\
    \ a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n    An\
    \ interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent\
    \ that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty\
    \ for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees\
    \ may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,\
    \ a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n    1. Source Code.\n  \
    \  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n\
    \    A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard\
    \ defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified\
    \ for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\
    \ working in that language.\n\n    The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work\
    \ include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the\
    \ normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\
    \ Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component,\
    \ or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available\
    \ to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means\
    \ a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific\
    \ operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used\
    \ to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n    The\
    \ \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source\
    \ code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\
    \ code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.\
    \ However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose\
    \ tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing\
    \ those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding\
    \ Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for\
    \ the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms\
    \ that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\
    \ communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the\
    \ work.\n\n    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\
    \ regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n \
    \   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\
    \    2. Basic Permissions.\n    All rights granted under this License are granted\
    \ for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\
    \ conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission\
    \ to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered\
    \ by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered\
    \ work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,\
    \ as provided by copyright law.\n\n    You may make, run and propagate covered\
    \ works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise\
    \ remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\
    \ of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities\
    \ for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License\
    \ in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus\
    \ making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\
    \ under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any\
    \ copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n\
    \    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\
    \ stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\
    \    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n    No covered\
    \ work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable\
    \ law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted\
    \ on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\
    \ of such measures.\n\n    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal\
    \ power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\
    \ is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered\
    \ work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the\
    \ work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'\
    \ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n    4. Conveying\
    \ Verbatim Copies.\n    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source\
    \ code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices\
    \ stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with\
    \ section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n \
    \   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you\
    \ may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n    5. Conveying Modified\
    \ Source Versions.\n    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications\
    \ to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of\
    \ section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n        a)\
    \ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving\
    \ a relevant date.\n        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that\
    \ it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.\
    \ This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all\
    \ notices\".\n        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\
    \ License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore\
    \ apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of\
    \ the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License\
    \ gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate\
    \ such permission if you have separately received it.\n        d) If the work\
    \ has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;\
    \ however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate\
    \ Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n    A compilation of a\
    \ covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their\
    \ nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such\
    \ as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\
    \ medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright\
    \ are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\
    \ beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\
    \ does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\
    \    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n    You may convey a covered work in object\
    \ code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey\
    \ the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in\
    \ one of these ways:\n        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a\
    \ physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by\
    \ the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange.\n        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\
    \ by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as\
    \ you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone\
    \ who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source\
    \ for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable\
    \ physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more\
    \ than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\
    \ or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\
    \        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\
    \ offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\
    \ occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with\
    \ such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n        d) Convey the object code\
    \ by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer\
    \ equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same\
    \ place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a\
    \ network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated\
    \ by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    \ Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\
    \ you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\
    \ satisfy these requirements.\n        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\
    \ subsection 6d.\n\n    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code\
    \ is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\
    \ in conveying the object code work.\n\n    A \"User Product\" is either (1) a\
    \ \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally\
    \ used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or\
    \ sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is\
    \ a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For\
    \ a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers\
    \ to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
    \ of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\
    \ or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product\
    \ regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\
    \ non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use\
    \ of the product.\n\n    \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means\
    \ any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\
    \ install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product\
    \ from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice\
    \ to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no\
    \ case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\
    \n    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically\
    \ for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction\
    \ in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\
    \ to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\
    \ is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must\
    \ be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not\
    \ apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\
    \ object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\
    \ ROM).\n\n    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\
    \ a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for\
    \ a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\
    \ Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
    \ be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\
    \ operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\
    \ across the network.\n\n    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\
    \ provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\
    \ (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and\
    \ must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\
    \    7. Additional Terms.\n    \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement\
    \ the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    \n    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove\
    \ any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\
    \ permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when\
    \ you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added\
    \ by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\
    \ permission.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for\
    \ material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright\
    \ holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\
    \        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms\
    \ of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n        b) Requiring preservation\
    \ of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material\
    \ or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n \
    \       c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring\
    \ that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different\
    \ from the original version; or\n        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes\
    \ of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n        e) Declining to\
    \ grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or\
    \ service marks; or\n        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors\
    \ of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\
    \ it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability\
    \ that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\
    \n    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\"\
    \ within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any\
    \ part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along\
    \ with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\
    \ document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\
    \ under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\
    \ of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive\
    \ such relicensing or conveying.\n\n    If you add terms to a covered work in\
    \ accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement\
    \ of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where\
    \ to find the applicable terms.\n\n    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,\
    \ may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\
    \ the above requirements apply either way.\n    8. Termination.\n    You may not\
    \ propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.\
    \ Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted\
    \ under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n    However, if you cease all violation\
    \ of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\
    \ (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\
    \ terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails\
    \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after\
    \ the cessation.\n\n    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder\
    \ is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation\
    \ by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\
    \ violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you\
    \ cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n  \
    \  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\
    \ of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\
    \ your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\
    \ qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n  \
    \  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n    You are not required to\
    \ accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary\
    \ propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\
    \ nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify\
    \ any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so.\n    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties with this License.\n\n    An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
    \ transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,\
    \ or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of\
    \ a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\
    \ who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\
    \ the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph,\
    \ plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\
    \ predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\
    \ efforts.\n\n    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise\
    \ of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\
    \ impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\
    \ under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\
    \ making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\
    \ of it.\n    11. Patents.\n    A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes\
    \ use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.\
    \ The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\
    \n    A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\
    \ or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\
    \ that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\
    \ using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\
    \ be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\
    \ version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to\
    \ grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\
    \ License.\n\n    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
    \ patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,\
    \ sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents\
    \ of its contributor version.\n\n    In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent\
    \ license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\
    \ enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant\
    \ not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\
    \ party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\
    \ against the party.\n\n    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on\
    \ a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n    If, pursuant to or in connection\
    \ with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring\
    \ conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
    \ receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey\
    \ a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n  \
    \  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope\
    \ of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\
    \ of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \n    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\
    \ implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available\
    \ to you under applicable patent law.\n    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\
    \    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n    Notwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n    14. Revised Versions of this License.\n    The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain\
    \ numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\n    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
    \ versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Program.\n\n    Later license versions may give you additional\
    \ or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on\
    \ any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later\
    \ version.\n    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\
    \ PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\
    \ IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"\
    AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n    16. Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\
    \ ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM\
    \ AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\
    \ THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\
    \ TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\
    \ BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n    17. Interpretation of\
    \ Sections 15 and 16.\n\n    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
    \ reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\
    \ waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty\
    \ or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a\
    \ fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New\
    \ Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
    \ possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\
    \ software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo\
    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\
    \ to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of\
    \ warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer\
    \ to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\
    \ a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis\
    \ program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the\
    \ terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n\
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\
    \ WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\
    \nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\
    \ this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's\
    \ commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\"\
    .\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\
    \ if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For\
    \ more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\
    \ If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\
    \ of this License. But first, please read <https: //www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>."

    \ (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is\
    \ the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes\
    \ with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software\
    \ are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,\
    \ the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share\
    \ and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\
    \nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\
    \ designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose\
    \ authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we\
    \ speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\
    \ or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\
    \ things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\
    \ anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\
    \ restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive\
    \ or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must\
    \ provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\
    \ with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting\
    \ your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this\
    \ license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\
    \ library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\
    \ that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If\
    \ the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\
    \ to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\
    \ introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\
    \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\
    \ to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually\
    \ obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary\
    \ software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\
    \ for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including\
    \ some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which\
    \ was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public\
    \ License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different\
    \ from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything\
    \ in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate\
    \ public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually\
    \ make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a\
    \ program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\
    \ using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application\
    \ program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined\
    \ work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public\
    \ License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the\
    \ ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\
    \ sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that\
    \ weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking\
    \ of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit\
    \ from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public\
    \ License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries,\
    \ while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\
    \ libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this\
    \ as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes\
    \ in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to\
    \ faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\
    \ between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\"\
    . The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works\
    \ together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered\
    \ by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n\
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n    0. This\
    \ License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed\
    \ under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"\
    ). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n    A \"library\" means a collection\
    \ of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with\
    \ application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\
    \n    The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which\
    \ has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means\
    \ either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,\
    \ a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\
    \ and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\
    \ is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n    \"Source\
    \ code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\
    \ to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the\
    \ scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   \
    \ Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\
    \ by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using\
    \ the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only\
    \ if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use\
    \ of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what\
    \ the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n    1. You\
    \ may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code\
    \ as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n    2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n        a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n        c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n        d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n        (For\
    \ example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that\
    \ is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection\
    \ 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function\
    \ must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function\
    \ must still compute square roots.)\n\n    These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim\
    \ rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent\
    \ is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n    In addition, mere aggregation of another\
    \ work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the\
    \ Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\
    \ other work under the scope of this License.\n    3. You may opt to apply the\
    \ terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to\
    \ a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public\
    \ License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version\
    \ 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\
    \ that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\
    \n    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,\
    \ so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies\
    \ and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n    This option is useful when\
    \ you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not\
    \ a library.\n    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\
    \ derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the\
    \ terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange.\n\n    If distribution of object code is made by offering access\
    \ to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\
    \ source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the\
    \ source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n    5. A program that contains no derivative of\
    \ any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being\
    \ compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such\
    \ a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore\
    \ falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n    However, linking a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative\
    \ of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a\
    \ \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this\
    \ License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  \
    \  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that\
    \ is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work\
    \ of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\
    \ significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\
    \ itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined\
    \ by law.\n\n    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\
    \ layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines\
    \ or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless\
    \ of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\
    \ code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n    Otherwise,\
    \ if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code\
    \ for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work\
    \ also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the\
    \ Library itself.\n    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also\
    \ compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce\
    \ a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms\
    \ of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for\
    \ the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
    \n    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library\
    \ is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\
    \ You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays\
    \ copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among\
    \ them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.\
    \ Also, you must do one of these things:\n        a) Accompany the work with the\
    \ complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including\
    \ whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with\
    \ the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code\
    \ and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink\
    \ to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood\
    \ that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will\
    \ not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\
    \        b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three\
    \ years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,\
    \ for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      \
    \  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated\
    \ place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the\
    \ same place.\n        d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of\
    \ these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n    For an\
    \ executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include\
    \ any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.\
    \ However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include\
    \ anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with\
    \ the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\
    \ which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\
    \n    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions\
    \ of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\
    \ system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\
    \ together in an executable that you distribute.\n    7. You may place library\
    \ facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library\
    \ together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\
    \ such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work\
    \ based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,\
    \ and provided that you do these two things:\n        a) Accompany the combined\
    \ library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any\
    \ other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections\
    \ above.\n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\
    \ that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find\
    \ the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n    8. You may not copy,\
    \ modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly\
    \ provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\
    \ rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated\
    \ so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n    9. You are not required\
    \ to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\
    \ grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative\
    \ works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\
    \ Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\
    \ Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its\
    \ terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works\
    \ based on it.\n    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based\
    \ on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\
    \ licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n    11. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n    If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole\
    \ is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n    It is not the purpose of\
    \ this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is\
    \ implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n    This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n    13. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General\
    \ Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\
    \ to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\
    \ concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\
    \ Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"\
    any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may\
    \ choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n    14.\
    \ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose\
    \ distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to\
    \ ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n    NO WARRANTY\n    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED\
    \ FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED\
    \ BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\
    \ AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\
    \ EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES\
    \ OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS\
    \ TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY\
    \ PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\
    \    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\
    \ WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\
    \ THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\
    \ GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE\
    \ OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\
    \ DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR\
    \ A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\
    \ OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF\
    \ TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf\
    \ you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\
    \ to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute\
    \ and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,\
    \ alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\n\n\
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest\
    \ to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\
    \ exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\"\
    \ line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the\
    \ library's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\n\
    \nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free\
    \ Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any\
    \ later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\
    \ but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License\
    \ for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library General\
    \ Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your\
    \ employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"\
    copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter\
    \ the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe\

    \ (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
    \ incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\
    \ License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\n    0.\
    \ Additional Definitions.\n\n        As used herein, \"this License\" refers to\
    \ version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers\
    \ to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n        \"The Library\" refers\
    \ to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined\
    \ Work as defined below.\n\n        An \"Application\" is any work that makes\
    \ use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based\
    \ on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed\
    \ a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n        A \"Combined\
    \ Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.\
    \ The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made\
    \ is also called the \"Linked Version\".\n\n        The \"Minimal Corresponding\
    \ Source\" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined\
    \ Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered\
    \ in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\
    \n        The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\
    \ object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility\
    \ programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but\
    \ excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n    1. Exception to Section\
    \ 3 of the GNU GPL.\n    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4\
    \ of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n    2. Conveying\
    \ Modified Versions.\n    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications,\
    \ a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that\
    \ uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),\
    \ then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n        a) under this License,\
    \ provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application\
    \ does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\
    \ whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n        b) under the GNU\
    \ GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that\
    \ copy.\n    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\
    \    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header\
    \ file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms\
    \ of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,\
    \ inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of\
    \ the following:\n        a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object\
    \ code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered\
    \ by this License.\n        b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU\
    \ GPL and this license document.\n    4. Combined Works.\n    You may convey a\
    \ Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do\
    \ not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined\
    \ Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do\
    \ each of the following:\n        a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the\
    \ Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use\
    \ are covered by this License.\n        b) Accompany the Combined Work with a\
    \ copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n        c) For a Combined Work\
    \ that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice\
    \ for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user\
    \ to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n        d) Do one of\
    \ the following:\n            0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under\
    \ the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\
    \ suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the\
    \ Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified\
    \ Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\
    \ Corresponding Source.\n            1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism\
    \ for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run\
    \ time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and\
    \ (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible\
    \ with the Linked Version.\n        e) Provide Installation Information, but only\
    \ if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section\
    \ 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary\
    \ to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining\
    \ or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.\
    \ (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal\
    \ Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,\
    \ you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section\
    \ 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n    5. Combined Libraries.\n\
    \    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side\
    \ by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are\
    \ not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined\
    \ library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n     \
    \   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\
    \ Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms\
    \ of this License.\n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library\
    \ that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find\
    \ the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n    6. Revised Versions\
    \ of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n    The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you\
    \ received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General\
    \ Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\
    \ following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any\
    \ later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\
    \ received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public\
    \ License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n    If the Library as you\
    \ received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement\
    \ of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that\
    \ version for the Library."
