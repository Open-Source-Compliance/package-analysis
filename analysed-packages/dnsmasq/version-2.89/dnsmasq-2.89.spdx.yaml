    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or\
    \ its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute\
    \ the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object\
    \ code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except\
    \ for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n \
    \  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
    \ the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   9.\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to\
    \ Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of\
    \ the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\
    \ pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\
    \nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis\
    \ program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge,\
    \ MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69,\
    \ Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims\
    \ all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers\
    \ to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n<signature of Ty Coon>,\

    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\

    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     one\
    \ line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy\

    \ it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\

    \nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n\
    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make\
    \ sure the software is free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies\
    \ to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program\
    \ whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software\
    \ is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply\
    \ it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n\
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free\
    \ programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights,\
    \ we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or\
    \ to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain\
    \ responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you\
    \ modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n\
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.\
    \ You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your\
    \ rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license\
    \ which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\
    \nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone\
    \ understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that\
    \ what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others\
    \ will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free\
    \ program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the\
    \ danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent\
    \ licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have\
    \ made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\
    \ licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\
    \ and\nmodification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\
    \ FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n\
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n\
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option\
    \ offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy\
    \ or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on\
    \ the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms\
    \ of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that\
    \ you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work\
    \ that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived\
    \ from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge\
    \ to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified\
    \ program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it,\
    \ when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to\
    \ print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice\
    \ and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n\
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.\
    \ But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work\
    \ based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole,\
    \ and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not\
    \ the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written\
    \ entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the\
    \ distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn\
    \ addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the\
    \ Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution\
    \ medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3.\
    \ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section\
    \ 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above\
    \ provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the\
    \ complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\
    \ software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for\
    \ at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n\
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto\
    \ distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\nallowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n\
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy\
    \ the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code,\
    \ even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the\
    \ object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n\
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy,\
    \ modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept\
    \ this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\
    \ and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe\
    \ Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or\
    \ any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license\
    \ from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject\
    \ to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions\
    \ on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence\
    \ of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\n\
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense\
    \ and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute\
    \ the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole\
    \ is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous\
    \ contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system\
    \ in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor\
    \ to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other\
    \ system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended\
    \ to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of\
    \ this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted\
    \ in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an\
    \ explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so\
    \ that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.\
    \ In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time. Such new\
    \ versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\
    \ detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing\
    \ version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which\
    \ applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the\
    \ terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published\
    \ by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\
    \ number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software\nFoundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program\
    \ into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write\
    \ to the author\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\
    \ Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n\
    make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n\
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR\
    \ AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n\
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your\

    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\
    \ to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <yyyy>\
    \ <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\
    \nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\
    \ you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could\
    \ even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should\
    \ also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any,\
    \ to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a\
    \ sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest\

    \ Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is\
    \ not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most\
    \ software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By\
    \ contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom\
    \ to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all\
    \ its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n\
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing\
    \ it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser\
    \ General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\
    \n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. \
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\
    \ rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\
    \ you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure\
    \ that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them\
    \ these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two\
    \ steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives\
    \ you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also,\
    \ for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone\
    \ understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that\
    \ what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others\
    \ will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free\
    \ program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the\
    \ danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent\
    \ licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have\
    \ made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\
    \ licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\
    \ and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
    \   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This\
    \ License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this\
    \ General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the\
    \ Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n\
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered\
    \ by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program\
    \ is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by\
    \ running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\
    \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code\
    \ as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n\
    along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n\
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date\
    \ of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n\
    \    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally\
    \ reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started\
    \ running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or\
    \ display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n\
    \    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a\
    \ warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if\
    \ the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which\
    \ is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the\
    \ terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n\
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the\
    \ Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n\
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage\
    \ or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this\
    \ License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on\
    \ it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n\
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   \
    \ a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third\
    \ party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source\
    \ distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source\
    \ code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\
    \ medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany\
    \ it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding\
    \ source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution\
    \ and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form\
    \ with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code\
    \ for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to\
    \ it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code\
    \ for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files,\
    \ plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.\
    \  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\n\
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with\
    \ the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system\
    \ on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the\
    \ executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy\
    \ the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code,\
    \ even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the\
    \ object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\
    \ Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept\
    \ this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\
    \ do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n\
    the Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a\
    \ license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\
    \ subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions\
    \ on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a\
    \ consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for\
    \ any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on\
    \ you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions\
    \ of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.\
    \  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\
    \ under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\
    \ you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense\
    \ would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who\
    \ receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could\
    \ satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution\
    \ of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\
    \ under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n\
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\
    \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents\
    \ or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this\
    \ section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software\
    \ distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many\
    \ people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n\
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it\
    \ is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software\
    \ through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis\
    \ section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence\
    \ of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program\
    \ is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\
    \ the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay\
    \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries,\
    \ so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.\
    \  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such\
    \ new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ\
    \ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing\
    \ version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License\
    \ which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following\
    \ the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published\
    \ by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version\
    \ number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program\
    \ into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write\
    \ to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by\
    \ the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n\
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n\
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\
    \ THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\
    \ COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT\
    \ UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS\
    \ PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO\
    \ USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\
    \ HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                  \
    \   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the\
    \ greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and\
    \ a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's\

  extractedText: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright\
    \ © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers\
    \ to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means\
    \ copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\
    \ License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from\
    \ or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA\
    \ \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work\
    \ means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object\
    \ code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means\
    \ an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards\
    \ body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\
    \ one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"\
    System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work\
    \ as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,\
    \ but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable\
    \ use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface\
    \ for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\
    \ A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,\
    \ window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\
    \ the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object\
    \ code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work\
    \ in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and\
    \ (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including\
    \ scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's\
    \ System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs\
    \ which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part\
    \ of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition\
    \ files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared\
    \ libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed\
    \ to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\
    \ subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not\
    \ include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of\
    \ the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code\
    \ form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this\
    \ License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable\
    \ provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your\
    \ unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running\
    \ a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,\
    \ constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use\
    \ or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and\
    \ propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as\
    \ your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others\
    \ for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,\
    \ or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply\
    \ with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\
    \ control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must\
    \ do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms\
    \ that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside\
    \ their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted\
    \ solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section\
    \ 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention\
    \ Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\
    \ under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\
    \ copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\
    \ restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work,\
    \ you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures\
    \ to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this\
    \ License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to\
    \ limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\
    \ the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey\
    \ verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,\
    \ provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
    \ non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\
    \ intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a\
    \ copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or\
    \ no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey\
    \ a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,\
    \ in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also\
    \ meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work\
    \ must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License\
    \ and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement\
    \ in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n     c) You must license the\
    \ entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession\
    \ of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section\
    \ 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless\
    \ of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work\
    \ in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately\
    \ received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must\
    \ display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces\
    \ that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them\
    \ do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
    \ works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which\
    \ are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation\
    \ and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights\
    \ of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion\
    \ of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the\
    \ other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey\
    \ a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided\
    \ that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms\
    \ of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in,\
    \ or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),\
    \ accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\
    \ by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as\
    \ you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone\
    \ who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source\
    \ for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable\
    \ physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more\
    \ than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\
    \ or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\
    \n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\
    \ offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\
    \ occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with\
    \ such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code\
    \ by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer\
    \ equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same\
    \ place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a\
    \ network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated\
    \ by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    \ Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\
    \ you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\
    \ satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\
    \ subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code\
    \ is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\
    \ in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"\
    consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally\
    \ used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or\
    \ sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is\
    \ a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For\
    \ a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers\
    \ to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
    \ of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\
    \ or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product\
    \ regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\
    \ non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use\
    \ of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any\
    \ methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\
    \ and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a\
    \ modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to\
    \ ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case\
    \ prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n\
    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically\
    \ for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction\
    \ in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\
    \ to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\
    \ is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must\
    \ be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not\
    \ apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\
    \ object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\
    \ ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\
    \ a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for\
    \ a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\
    \ Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
    \ be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\
    \ operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\
    \ across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\
    \ provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\
    \ (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and\
    \ must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\
    \n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the\
    \ terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    \nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\
    \ additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions\
    \ may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify\
    \ the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to\
    \ a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\
    \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to\
    \ a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\
    \ supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty\
    \ or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this\
    \ License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\
    \ notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\
    \ Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation\
    \ of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such\
    \ material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version;\
    \ or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\
    \ or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark\
    \ law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f)\
    \ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone\
    \ who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions\
    \ of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions\
    \ directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive\
    \ additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning\
    \ of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains\
    \ a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that\
    \ is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\
    \ a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License,\
    \ you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license\
    \ document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing\
    \ or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,\
    \ you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional\
    \ terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable\
    \ terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\
    \ form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered\
    \ work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\
    \ under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\
    \ of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then\
    \ your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the\
    \ same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\
    \ of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as\
    \ a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise\
    \ does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants\
    \ you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\
    \ copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating\
    \ a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10.\
    \ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered\
    \ work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,\
    \ to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\
    \ responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\
    An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization,\
    \ or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging\
    \ organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\
    \ each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives\
    \ whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
    \ give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has\
    \ it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.\
    \ For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\
    \ exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
    \ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent\
    \ claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing\
    \ the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright\
    \ holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which\
    \ the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"\
    contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all\
    \ patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired\
    \ or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by\
    \ this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not\
    \ include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\
    \ of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes\
    \ the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\
    \ royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,\
    \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\
    \ the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs,\
    \ a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,\
    \ not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\
    \ or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent\
    \ license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce\
    \ a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying\
    \ on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with\
    \ a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\
    \ of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving\
    \ the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific\
    \ copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent\
    \ license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its\
    \ coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of\
    \ one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain\
    \ numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
    \ versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or\
    \ different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
    \ author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\
    \n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED\
    \ BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY\
    \ OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE\
    \ TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\
    \ DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\
    \ NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
    \ BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\
    \ PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer\
    \ of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local\
    \ legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law\
    \ that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\
    \ connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies\
    \ a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program,\
    \ and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way\
    \ to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute\
    \ and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the\
    \ program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\
    \ effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\
    \ the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\
    \     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\
    \     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n     This program is free software:\
    \ you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version\
    \ 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program\
    \ is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.\
    \  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how\
    \ to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n     This program\
    \ comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n     This is\
    \ free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\
    \ type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c'\
    \ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course,\
    \ your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use\
    \ an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\
    \ For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\
    \ If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\
    \ of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>."
