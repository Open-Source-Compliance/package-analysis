    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\

    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\

    \ rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the\

    \ authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\
    \ other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the\
    \ material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes\
    \ be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged\
    \ to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\

    \ Definitions.\n\n     a.\tAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright\
    \ and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\
    \ and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed,\
    \ or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and\
    \ Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where\
    \ the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted\
    \ Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed\
    \ relation with a moving image.\n\n     b.\tAdapter's License means the license\
    \ You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted\
    \ Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\
    \n     c.\tCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\
    \ closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,\
    \ sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the\
    \ rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the\
    \ rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\
    \n     d.\tEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\
    \ absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations\
    \ under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,\
    \ and/or similar international agreements.\n\n     e.\tExceptions and Limitations\

    \ or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has\
    \ a corresponding meaning.\n\nSection 2 - Scope.\n\n     a.\tLicense grant.\n\n\
    \          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the\
    \ Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,\
    \ irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material\
    \ to:\n\n               A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole\
    \ or in part; and\n\n               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\
    \n          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions\
    \ and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You\
    \ do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n          3. Term. The\
    \ term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n          4. Media\
    \ and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to\
    \ exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter\
    \ created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor\
    \ waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from\
    \ making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\
    \ technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.\
    \ For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized\
    \ by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n          5. Downstream\
    \ recipients.\n\n               A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material.\
    \ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from\
    \ the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions\
    \ of this Public License.\n\n               B. No downstream restrictions. You\
    \ may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on,\
    \ or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing\
    \ so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\
    \ Material.\n\n          6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes\
    \ or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your\
    \ use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or\
    \ granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution\
    \ as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. Other rights.\n\n          1. Moral\
    \ rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License,\
    \ nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,\
    \ to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any\
    \ such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You\
    \ to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n          2. Patent and\
    \ trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n          3.\
    \ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from\
    \ You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting\
    \ society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.\
    \ In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such\
    \ royalties.\n\nSection 3 - License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed\
    \ Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n     a.\tAttribution.\n\
    \n          1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),\
    \ You must:\n\n               A. retain the following if it is supplied by the\
    \ Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n                    i. identification\
    \ of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive\
    \ attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by\
    \ pseudonym if designated);\n\n                    ii. a copyright notice;\n\n\
    \                    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n   \
    \                 iv.\ta notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\
    \n                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent\
    \ reasonably practicable;\n\n               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed\
    \ Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n   \
    \            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,\
    \ and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n\
    \          2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable\
    \ manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed\
    \ Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing\
    \ a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n\
    \          3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information\
    \ required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n   \
    \       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You\
    \ apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with\
    \ this Public License.\n\nSection 4 - Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the\
    \ Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of\
    \ the Licensed Material:\n\n     a.\tfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1)\
    \ grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\
    \ portion of the contents of the database;\n\n     b.\tif You include all or a\
    \ substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have\
    \ Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis\
    \ Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\
    \n     c.\tYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all\
    \ or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance\
    \ of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under\
    \ this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar\
    \ Rights.\n\nSection 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \n     a.\tUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\
    \ possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\
    \ and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed\
    \ Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without\
    \ limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,\
    \ non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence\
    \ or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers\
    \ of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply\
    \ to You.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be\
    \ liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)\
    \ or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,\
    \ exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\
    \ Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been\
    \ advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where\
    \ a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation\
    \ may not apply to You.\n\n     c.\tThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation\
    \ of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\
    \ possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all\
    \ liability.\n\nSection 6 - Term and Termination.\n\n     a.\tThis Public License\
    \ applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However,\
    \ if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this\
    \ Public License terminate automatically.\n\n     b.\tWhere Your right to use\
    \ the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n\
    \          1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it\
    \ is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n         \
    \ 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     c.\tFor the avoidance\
    \ of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have\
    \ to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n     d.\tFor\
    \ the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under\
    \ separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any\
    \ time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n     e.\t\
    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection\
    \ 7 - Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n     a.\tThe Licensor shall not be bound\
    \ by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless\
    \ expressly agreed.\n\n     b.\tAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements\
    \ regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent\
    \ of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 - Interpretation.\n\
    \n     a.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall\
    \ not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any\
    \ use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission\
    \ under this Public License.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent possible, if any provision\
    \ of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed\
    \ to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot\
    \ be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting\
    \ the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n     c.\tNo term\
    \ or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply\
    \ consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n     d.\tNothing\
    \ in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon,\
    \ or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You,\

    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\
    \ achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\
    \ change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     one\
    \ line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy\
    \ name of author\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it\
    \ and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\
    \ option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that\
    \ it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\
    \ of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General\

    \ Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\
    \ 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     Gnomovision version\
    \ 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\

    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby\

    \n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n     a.  in the case of Lucent\
    \ Technologies Inc. (\"LUCENT\"), the Original Program, and\n     b.  in the case\
    \ of each Contributor,\n\n          i.  changes to the Program, and\n        \

    \ to the Program were added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\

    \ has Contributed a Contribution to the Program.\n\n\"Distributor\" means a Recipient\
    \ that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.\n\
    \n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\
    \ necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined\
    \ with the Program.\n\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the\
    \ software accompanying this Agreement as released by LUCENT, including source\
    \ code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n\"Program\" means the Original\
    \ Program and Contributions or any part thereof\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone\
    \ who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\
    \n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n     a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\
    \ Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
    \ copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\
    \ publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\
    \ if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n\
    \     b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
    \ Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\
    \ Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\
    \ Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\
    \ The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination\
    \ of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the\
    \ Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution\
    \ causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\
    \ granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which\
    \ include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No\
    \ hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n     c.  Recipient understands that\
    \ although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth\
    \ herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does\
    \ not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\
    \ Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\
    \ any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.\
    \ As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\
    \ Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\
    \ property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license\
    \ is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's\
    \ responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n\
    \     d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\
    \ copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\
    \ set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n     A. Distributor may choose\
    \ to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own\
    \ license agreement, provided that:\n\n          1.  it complies with the terms\
    \ and conditions of this Agreement;\n          2.  if the Program is distributed\
    \ in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's\
    \ own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\n     \
    \     3.  if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license\
    \ agreement:\n\n               a.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors\
    \ all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\
    \ conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions\
    \ of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n               b.\
    \  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,\
    \ including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such\
    \ as lost profits; and\n               c.  states that any provisions which differ\
    \ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\
    \ party.\n\n     B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous\
    \ location in the Program:\n\n     Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc.\
    \ and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\n     C. In addition, each Contributor must\
    \ identify itself as the originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably\
    \ allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\
    \ Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes are intended\
    \ to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter\
    \ be revoked.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software\
    \ may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners\
    \ and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\
    \ of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\
    \ offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability\
    \ for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial\
    \ product offering, such Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees\
    \ to defend and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against\
    \ any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\
    \ lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\
    \ Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\
    \ Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\
    \ product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\
    \ or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\
    \ In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the\
    \ Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\
    \ Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the\
    \ defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor\
    \ may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Distributor\
    \ might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That\
    \ Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor\
    \ then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those\
    \ performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility\
    \ alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims\
    \ against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties,\
    \ and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\
    \ Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS\
    \ EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\
    \ BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\
    \ INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\
    \ MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\
    \ responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the\
    \ Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this\
    \ Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\
    \ compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,\
    \ and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
    \nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\
    \ SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER\
    \ CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,\
    \ OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE\
    \ OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,\
    \ EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. EXPORT CONTROL\n\n\
    Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the United\
    \ States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation\
    \ of any other countries).\n\n8. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement\
    \ is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity\
    \ or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without\
    \ further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\
    \ minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf\
    \ Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\
    \ a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in\
    \ a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\
    \ under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
    \ In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\
    \ a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\
    \ (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\
    \ such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section\
    \ 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's\
    \ rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of\
    \ the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure\
    \ in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If\
    \ all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease\
    \ use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,\
    \ Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\
    \ relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nLUCENT may publish new\
    \ versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new\
    \ version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\
    \ Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version\
    \ of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version\
    \ of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\
    \ (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than LUCENT\
    \ has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections\
    \ 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual\
    \ property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\
    \ estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under\
    \ this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the\
    \ State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of\
    \ America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\
    \ more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\
    \ to a jury trial in any resulting litigation."
