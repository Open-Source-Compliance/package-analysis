Export-Restriction
Export Requirements.

You may not export or re-export this software or any copy or
adaptation in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, hardware, software,
technology or services provided under this license agreement may not
be exported, reexported, transferred or downloaded to or within (or to
a national resident of) countries under U.S. economic embargo
including the following countries:

Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. This list is subject
to change.

Hardware, software, technology or services may not be exported,
reexported, transferred or downloaded to persons or entities listed on
the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List, Entity List of
proliferation concern or on any U.S. Treasury Department Designated
Nationals exclusion list, or to parties directly or indirectly
involved in the development or production of nuclear, chemical,
biological weapons or in missile technology programs as specified in
the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 744).

By accepting this license agreement you confirm that you are not
located in (or a national resident of) any country under U.S. economic
embargo, not identified on any U.S. Department of Commerce Denied
Persons List, Entity List or Treasury Department Designated Nationals
exclusion list, and not directly or indirectly involved in the
development or production of nuclear, chemical, biological weapons or
in missile technology programs as specified in the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations.

Software available on this web site contains cryptography and is
therefore subject to US government export control under the
U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"). EAR Part 740.13(e)
allows the export and reexport of publicly available encryption source
code that is not subject to payment of license fee or royalty
payment. Object code resulting from the compiling of such source code
may also be exported and reexported under this provision if publicly
available and not subject to a fee or payment other than reasonable
and customary fees for reproduction and distribution. This kind of
encryption source code and the corresponding object code may be
exported or reexported without prior U.S. government export license
authorization provided that the U.S. government is notified about the
Internet location of the software.

The open source software available on this web site is publicly
available without license fee or royalty payment, and all binary
software is compiled from the source code. The U.S. government has
been notified about this site and the location site for the source
code. Therefore, the source code and compiled object code may be
downloaded and exported under U.S. export license exception (without a
U.S. export license) in accordance with the further restrictions
outlined above regarding embargoed countries, restricted persons and
restricted end uses.

Local Country Import Requirements. The software you are about to
download contains cryptography technology. Some countries regulate the
import, use and/or export of certain products with cryptography. The
X.org Foundation makes no claims as to the applicability of local
country import, use and/or export regulations in relation to the
download of this product. If you are located outside the U.S. and
Canada you are advised to consult your local country regulations to
insure compliance.
