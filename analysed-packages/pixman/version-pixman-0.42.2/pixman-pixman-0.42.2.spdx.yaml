    \ TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION\
    \ OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n     a.\
    \ \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other\
    \ pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement\
    \ of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or\
    \ performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which\
    \ the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\
    \ derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection\
    \ will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the\
    \ avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram,\
    \ the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\"\
    ) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n     b.\
    \ \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias\
    \ and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or\
    \ subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason\
    \ of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual\
    \ creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form\
    \ along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent\
    \ works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A\
    \ work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as\
    \ defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n     c. \"Distribute\" means\
    \ to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation,\
    \ as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n     d. \"Licensor\"\
    \ means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n     e. \"Original Author\" means, in the\
    \ case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or\
    \ entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified,\
    \ the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors,\
    \ singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\
    \ play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions\
    \ of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or\
    \ legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\
    \ (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\
    \n     f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\
    \ of this License including without limitation any production in the literary,\
    \ scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression\
    \ including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture,\
    \ address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical\
    \ work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition\
    \ with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works\
    \ expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,\
    \ architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which\
    \ are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work\
    \ of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\
    \ relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a\
    \ broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected\
    \ as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer\
    \ to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n\
    \     g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\
    \ who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\
    \ Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights\
    \ under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n     h. \"Publicly Perform\"\
    \ means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public\
    \ those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless\
    \ means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works\
    \ in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place\
    \ and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\
    \ by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances\
    \ of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast\
    \ the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n     i. \"Reproduce\"\
    \ means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by\
    \ sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations\
    \ of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital\
    \ form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this\
    \ License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright\
    \ or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection\
    \ with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\
    \n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\
    \ hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\
    \ duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the\
    \ Work as stated below:\n\n     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work\
    \ into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\
    \ Collections;\n\n     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any\
    \ such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps\
    \ to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to\
    \ the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original\
    \ work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate\
    \ \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n     c. to Distribute and Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n     d. to\
    \ Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n     e. For the avoidance of\
    \ doubt:\n\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\
    \ in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\
    \ licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right\
    \ to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under\
    \ this License;\n\n          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\
    \ jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory\
    \ or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive\
    \ right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\
    \ under this License; and,\n\n          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor\
    \ waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event\
    \ that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\
    \ licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\
    \ granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media\
    \ and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include\
    \ the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise\
    \ the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not\
    \ expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license\
    \ granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following\
    \ restrictions:\n\n     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only\
    \ under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\
    \ Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\
    \ Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\
    \ Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient\
    \ of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms\
    \ of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices\
    \ that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy\
    \ of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on\
    \ the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise\
    \ the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section\
    \ 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not\
    \ require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the\
    \ terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor\
    \ You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\
    \ required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice\
    \ from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation\
    \ any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n     b. If You Distribute,\
    \ or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless\
    \ a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\
    \ notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are\
    \ utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)\
    \ if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another\
    \ party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\
    \ attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms\
    \ of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;\
    \ (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,\
    \ the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\
    \ such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for\
    \ the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\
    \ a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation\
    \ of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by\
    \ Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented\
    \ in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation\
    \ or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\
    \ authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits\
    \ and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\
    \ authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by\
    \ this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,\
    \ by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\
    \ assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\
    \ Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\
    \ use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the\
    \ Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n     c. Except as otherwise\
    \ agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable\
    \ law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\
    \ or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,\
    \ modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\
    \ prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that\
    \ in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted\
    \ in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed\
    \ to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial\
    \ to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not\
    \ assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\
    \ applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\
    \ Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\
    \n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED\
    \ TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS\
    \ OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR\
    \ OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\
    \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT\
    \ OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR\
    \ NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,\
    \ SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT\
    \ TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE\
    \ TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\
    \ OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN\
    \ IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\
    \n     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\
    \ upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\
    \ who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities\
    \ remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\
    \ will survive any termination of this License.\n\n     b. Subject to the above\
    \ terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\
    \ of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor\
    \ reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop\
    \ distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election\
    \ will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,\
    \ or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License\
    \ will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n\
    8. Miscellaneous\n\n     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work\
    \ or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\
    \ on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\
    \n     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\
    \ offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\
    \ conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     c. If any\
    \ provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,\
    \ it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms\
    \ of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\
    \ such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
    \ provision valid and enforceable.\n\n     d. No term or provision of this License\
    \ shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent\
    \ shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\
    \ consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\
    \ respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or\
    \ representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall\
    \ not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication\
    \ from You.\n\n     e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\
    \ agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n     f. The rights granted under, and\
    \ the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology\
    \ of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\
    \ amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\
    \ Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the\
    \ Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and\
    \ subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License\
    \ terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of\
    \ the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\
    \ If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes\
    \ additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are\
    \ deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict\
    \ the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\

    \ Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,\
    \ irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material\
    \ to:\n\n               A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole\

    \ term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n          4. Media\

    \ making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\
    \ technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.\
    \ For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized\
    \ by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n          5. Downstream\
    \ recipients.\n\n               A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material.\

    \ may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on,\
    \ or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing\
    \ so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\
    \ Material.\n\n          6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes\
    \ or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your\
    \ use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or\
    \ granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution\
    \ as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. Other rights.\n\n          1. Moral\
    \ rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License,\
    \ nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,\
    \ to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any\
    \ such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You\
    \ to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n          2. Patent and\
    \ trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n          3.\
    \ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from\
    \ You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting\
    \ society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.\
    \ In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such\
    \ royalties.\n\nSection 3 - License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed\
    \ Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n     a.\tAttribution.\n\
    \n          1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),\
    \ You must:\n\n               A. retain the following if it is supplied by the\
    \ Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n                    i. identification\
    \ of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive\
    \ attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by\
    \ pseudonym if designated);\n\n                    ii. a copyright notice;\n\n\
    \                    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n   \
    \                 iv.\ta notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\
    \n                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent\
    \ reasonably practicable;\n\n               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed\
    \ Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n   \
    \            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,\
    \ and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n\
    \          2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable\
    \ manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed\
    \ Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing\
    \ a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n\
    \          3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information\
    \ required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n   \
    \       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You\
    \ apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with\
    \ this Public License.\n\nSection 4 - Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the\
    \ Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of\
    \ the Licensed Material:\n\n     a.\tfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1)\
    \ grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\
    \ portion of the contents of the database;\n\n     b.\tif You include all or a\
    \ substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have\
    \ Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis\
    \ Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\
    \n     c.\tYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all\
    \ or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance\
    \ of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under\
    \ this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar\
    \ Rights.\n\nSection 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \n     a.\tUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\
    \ possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\
    \ and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed\
    \ Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without\
    \ limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,\
    \ non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence\
    \ or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers\
    \ of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply\
    \ to You.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be\
    \ liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)\
    \ or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,\
    \ exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\
    \ Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been\
    \ advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where\
    \ a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation\
    \ may not apply to You.\n\n     c.\tThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation\
    \ of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\
    \ possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all\
    \ liability.\n\nSection 6 - Term and Termination.\n\n     a.\tThis Public License\
    \ applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However,\
    \ if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this\
    \ Public License terminate automatically.\n\n     b.\tWhere Your right to use\
    \ the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n\
    \          1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it\
    \ is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n         \
    \ 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     c.\tFor the avoidance\
    \ of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have\
    \ to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n     d.\tFor\
    \ the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under\
    \ separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any\
    \ time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n     e.\t\
    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection\
    \ 7 - Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n     a.\tThe Licensor shall not be bound\
    \ by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless\
    \ expressly agreed.\n\n     b.\tAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements\
    \ regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent\
    \ of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 - Interpretation.\n\
    \n     a.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall\
    \ not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any\
    \ use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission\
    \ under this Public License.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent possible, if any provision\
    \ of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed\
    \ to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot\
    \ be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting\
    \ the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n     c.\tNo term\
    \ or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply\
    \ consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n     d.\tNothing\
    \ in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon,\
    \ or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You,\
    \ including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nCreative\

    \  HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout\
    \ the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined\
    \ below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\"\
    ) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\n\
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe\
    \ purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works\
    \ (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims\
    \ of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute\
    \ as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including\
    \ without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the\

    \ creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution\
    \ for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these\
    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly\
    \ distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of\
    \ CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available\
    \ under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"\
    Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\
    \ not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,\
    \ perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights\
    \ retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and\
    \ privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in\
    \ a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n\
    \     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting\
    \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi.\
    \ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n    \
    \ European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection\
    \ of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including\
    \ any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar,\
    \ equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable\
    \ law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver.\
    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including\
    \ existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\
    \ all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\n\
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding\
    \ without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"\
    Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public\
    \ at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending\
    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\
    \ termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment\
    \ of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of\
    \ Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\
    \ reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then\
    \ the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the\
    \ Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free,\
    \ non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional\
    \ license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i)\
    \ in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future\
    \ medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including\
    \ without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"\
    License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied\
    \ by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged\
    \ legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity\
    \ or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in\
    \ such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any\
    \ of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert\
    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\
    \ and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\
    \ abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\
    \ b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties\
    \ of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise,\
    \ including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness\
    \ for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or\
    \ other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
    \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
    \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\
    \ disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions\
    \ or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands\
    \ and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document\
