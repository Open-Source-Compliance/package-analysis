THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:
     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
          i) changes to the Program, and
          ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

     b) its license agreement:
          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</spdx:extractedText>

        <spdx:extractedText>Multi-licensing is the practice of distributing software under two or more different sets of terms and conditions. This may mean multiple different software licenses or sets of licenses. Prefixes may be used to indicate the number of licenses used, e.g. dual-licensed for software licensed under two different licenses.
When software is multi-licensed, recipients can choose which terms under which they want to use or distribute the software. The distributor may or may not apply a fee to either option. The two usual motivations for multi-licensing are license compatibility and market segregation based business models.</spdx:extractedText>

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;yyyy&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability ('notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.</spdx:extractedText>

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="i.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="ii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iv.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="v.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="vi.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="vii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations and Disclaimers.
      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

          i) changes to the Program, and

          ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

     b) its license agreement:

          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</spdx:extractedText>

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy name of author

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/
and the Eclipse Distribution License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/
and the Eclipse Distribution License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

     1.6. "Initial Developer" means the individual or entity identified as the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.

     1.7. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

     1.8. "License" means this document.

     1.8.1. "Licensable" means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights conveyed herein.

     1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:

For purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Source Code License.

     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

          a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
          b. under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).
          c. the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.
          d. Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

     2.2. Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

          a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
          b. under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
          c. the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
          d. Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          (c) Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. Termination

     8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

          a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
          b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. government end users
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. Responsibility for claims
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. Multiple-licensed code
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

This program and the accompanying materials

The Eclipse Public License is available at

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

This program and the accompanying materials
are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v2.0
and Eclipse Distribution License v1.0 which accompany this distribution.

The Eclipse Public License is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/

For an explanation of what dual-licensing means to you, see:

Visiting the link showed the information below

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.

https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC
For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made available under two licenses. For example: "This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 which accompanies this distribution." What is meant by the use of the conjunction "and"?
The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under.

Thus the user is free to choose the License, it is a classical dual license case.
