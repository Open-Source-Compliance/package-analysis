Yes, you have my permission to make the changes. It was a mistake. I was more
concerned at the time about making things work and overlooked the license
change detail. It looks like audit 3.0 through 3.0.9 are the only releases
with this issue. Also, audit_fgets is not a public API so there are no
external users of the API. It is used by other applications that are part of
the auditd plugins.

HTH...
