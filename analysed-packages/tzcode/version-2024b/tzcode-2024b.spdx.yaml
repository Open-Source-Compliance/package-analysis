    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\

    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\

    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\

    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\

    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \

    \ means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives\
    \ of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either\
    \ the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n     \"Distribute\" means providing\
    \ a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case\
    \ of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\
    \n     \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this\
    \ Package or providing support for this Package to another party.  It does not\
    \ mean licensing fees.\n\n     \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it\
    \ has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\
    \ by the Copyright Holder.\n\n     \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if\
    \ it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\
    \ Holder.\n\n     \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed\
    \ with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may\
    \ be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n     \"Source\" form means\
    \ the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\n\
    \n     \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or\
    \ any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the\
    \ Source form.\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n\
    (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified\
    \ Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute\
    \ the Modified Version.\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\
    \n(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version\
    \ of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor\
    \ Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated\
    \ disclaimers.  At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include\
    \ a Compiled form of the Package.\n\n(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability\
    \ changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. \
    \ The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as\
    \ such will be subject to the Original License.\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions\
    \ of the Package as Source\n\n(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as\
    \ Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled\
    \ form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\
    \ from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard\
    \ features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of\
    \ the following:\n\n     (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright\
    \ Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright\
    \ Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\n     (b) ensure\
    \ that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing\
    \ or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear\
    \ a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\n     (c) allow\
    \ anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of\
    \ the Modified Version available to others under\n\n          (i) the Original\
    \ License or\n          (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\
    \ modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms\
    \ that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source\
    \ form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\
    \ available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\n\
    \nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions\
    \ without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard\
    \ Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions\
    \ on how to get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\
    \ valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time\
    \ while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide\
    \ new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid\
    \ instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware\
    \ that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights\
    \ under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled\
    \ form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect\
    \ to the Source of the Modified Version.\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\
    \n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified\
    \ Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided\
    \ that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package.  Distributor Fees are\
    \ permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted.\
    \ The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard\
    \ or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted\
    \ to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package\
    \ in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions\
    \ of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without\
    \ restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\
    \nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including,\
    \ but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the\
    \ Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version.\
    \  In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and\
    \ are not subject to the terms of this license.\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)\
    \  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\
    \ is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the\
    \ Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package,\
    \ if you do not accept this license.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been\
    \ derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless\
    \ required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements\
    \ of this license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any\
    \ trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)\
    \  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license\
    \ to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer\
    \ the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder\
    \ that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\
    \ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the\
    \ Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic\
    \ License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\n\n\
    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER\

    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\

    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\

    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\

    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\

    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\

    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or\
    \ its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute\
    \ the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object\
    \ code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except\
    \ for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n \
    \  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
    \ the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   9.\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to\
    \ Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of\
    \ the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\
    \ pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\
    \nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis\
    \ program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\

    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69,\

    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims\

    \ (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is\
    \ the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes\
    \ with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software\
    \ are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,\
    \ the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share\
    \ and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\
    \nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\
    \ designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose\
    \ authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we\
    \ speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\
    \ or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\
    \ things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\
    \ anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\
    \ restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive\
    \ or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must\
    \ provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\
    \ with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting\
    \ your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this\
    \ license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\
    \ library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\
    \ that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If\
    \ the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\
    \ to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\
    \ introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\
    \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\
    \ to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually\
    \ obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary\
    \ software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\
    \ for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including\
    \ some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which\
    \ was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public\
    \ License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different\
    \ from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything\
    \ in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate\
    \ public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually\
    \ make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a\
    \ program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\
    \ using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application\
    \ program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined\
    \ work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public\
    \ License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the\
    \ ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\
    \ sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that\
    \ weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking\
    \ of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit\
    \ from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public\
    \ License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries,\
    \ while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\
    \ libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this\
    \ as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes\
    \ in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to\
    \ faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\
    \ between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\"\
    . The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works\
    \ together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered\
    \ by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n\
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This\
    \ License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed\
    \ under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"\
    ). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   A \"library\" means a collection\
    \ of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with\
    \ application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\
    \n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which\
    \ has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means\
    \ either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,\
    \ a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\
    \ and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\
    \ is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n   \"Source\
    \ code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\
    \ to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the\
    \ scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   Activities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is\
    \ not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\
    \ in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library\
    \ does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n   1. You may copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n      (For\
    \ example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that\
    \ is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection\
    \ 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function\
    \ must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function\
    \ must still compute square roots.)\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\
    \ or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is\
    \ to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work\
    \ not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)\
    \ on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\
    \ under the scope of this License.\n\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of\
    \ the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy\
    \ of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\
    \ License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version\
    \ 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\
    \ if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n   Once this\
    \ change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works\
    \ made from that copy.\n\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part\
    \ of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n   4. You\
    \ may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   If distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n   5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n \
    \  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\
    \ an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\
    \ of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\
    \ is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\
    \ of such executables.\n\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material\
    \ from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work\
    \ may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\
    \ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without\
    \ the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be\
    \ true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n   If such an object file uses only\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros\
    \ and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\
    \ object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\
    \ work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\
    \ will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative\
    \ of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms\
    \ of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\
    \ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n   6. As\
    \ an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\
    \ the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\
    \ the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\
    \ engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n   You must give prominent\
    \ notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\
    \ Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\
    \ License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\
    \ the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing\
    \ the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\
    \n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\
    \ (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\
    \ an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"\
    work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\
    \ can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\
    \ the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents\
    \ of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile\
    \ the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n      b) Accompany the\
    \ work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same\
    \ user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than\
    \ the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n      c) If distribution of the\
    \ work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\
    \ access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\n      d)\
    \ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that\
    \ you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n   For an executable, the required\
    \ form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility\
    \ programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special\
    \ exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\
    \ distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\
    \ kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless\
    \ that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   It may happen that this\
    \ requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries\
    \ that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means\
    \ you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\
    \ distribute.\n\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based\
    \ on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\
    \ facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,\
    \ provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and\
    \ of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you\
    \ do these two things:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy\
    \ of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.\
    \ This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b)\
    \ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it\
    \ is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying\
    \ uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this\
    \ License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\
    \ the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\
    \ License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\
    \ this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\
    \ remain in full compliance.\n\n   9. You are not required to accept this License,\
    \ since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to\
    \ modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\
    \ prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying\
    \ or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n   10.\
    \ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the\
    \ recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\
    \ distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.\
    \ You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\
    \ rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\
    \ parties to this License.\n\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment\
    \ or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\
    \ patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\
    \ or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\
    \ you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\
    \ simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\
    \ then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,\
    \ if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Library.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held\
    \ invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\
    \ section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\
    \ in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce\
    \ you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
    \ of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity\
    \ of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license\
    \ practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\
    \ software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application\
    \ of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\
    \ to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\
    \ that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\
    \ believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n   12. If the distribution\
    \ and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents\
    \ or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\
    \ under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\
    \ excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\
    \ countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts\
    \ of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it\
    \ free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\
    \ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\
    \ ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following\
    \ notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source\
    \ file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\
    \ have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice\
    \ is found.\n\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\
    \nCopyright (C) year name of author\n\nThis library is free software; you can\
    \ redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\
    \ 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is\
    \ distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without\
    \ even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\

    \nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street,\
    \ Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\
    \ allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\
    \ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version\
    \ number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take\
    \ away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\
    \ Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\
    \ make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser\
    \ General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically\
    \ libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\
    \ it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\
    \ this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\
    \ use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak\
    \ of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software\
    \ and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\
    \ which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n \
    \  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared\
    \ so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\
    \ those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n   The \"Library\", below,\
    \ refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under\
    \ these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included\
    \ without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n   \"Source code\" for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules\
    \ it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\
    \ used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   Activities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is\
    \ not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\
    \ in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library\
    \ does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n   1. You may copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n   (For example,\
    \ a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely\
    \ well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires\
    \ that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be\
    \ optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must\
    \ still compute square roots.)\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\
    \ or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is\
    \ to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work\
    \ not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)\
    \ on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\
    \ under the scope of this License.\n\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of\
    \ the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy\
    \ of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\
    \ License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version\
    \ 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\
    \ if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n   Once this\
    \ change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works\
    \ made from that copy.\n\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part\
    \ of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n   4. You\
    \ may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   If distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n   5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n \
    \  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\
    \ an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\
    \ of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\
    \ is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\
    \ of such executables.\n\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material\
    \ from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work\
    \ may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\
    \ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without\
    \ the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be\
    \ true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n   If such an object file uses only\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros\
    \ and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\
    \ object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\
    \ work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\
    \ will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative\
    \ of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms\
    \ of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\
    \ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n   6. As\
    \ an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\
    \ the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\
    \ the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\
    \ engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n   You must give prominent\
    \ notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\
    \ Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\
    \ License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\
    \ the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing\
    \ the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\
    \n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\
    \ (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\
    \ an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"\
    work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\
    \ can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\
    \ the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents\
    \ of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile\
    \ the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n      b) Use a suitable\
    \ shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\
    \ is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\
    \ user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable,\
    \ and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the\
    \ user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with\
    \ the version that the work was made with.\n\n      c) Accompany the work with\
    \ a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials\
    \ specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing\
    \ this distribution.\n\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering\
    \ access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the\
    \ above specified materials from the same place.\n\n      e) Verify that the user\
    \ has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent\
    \ this user a copy.\n\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing\
    \ the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be\
    \ distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\
    \ source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\
    \ of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\
    \ itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   It may happen that this requirement\
    \ contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do\
    \ not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you\
    \ cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\
    \n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\
    \ side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\
    \ covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\
    \ the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\
    \ library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\
    \ things:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\
    \ based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b) Give prominent\
    \ notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based\
    \ on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form\
    \ of the same work.\n\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,\
    \ or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any\
    \ attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\
    \ Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\
    \ However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\
    \ compliance.\n\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you\
    \ have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\
    \ distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited\
    \ by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing\
    \ the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance\
    \ of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing\
    \ or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n   10. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with\
    \ or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose\
    \ any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\
    \ You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\
    \ License.\n\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\
    \ patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\
    \ your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then\
    \ as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if\
    \ a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Library.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held\
    \ invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\
    \ section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\
    \ in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce\
    \ you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
    \ of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity\
    \ of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license\
    \ practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\
    \ software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application\
    \ of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\
    \ to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\
    \ that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\
    \ believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n   12. If the distribution\
    \ and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents\
    \ or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\
    \ under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\
    \ excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\
    \ countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts\
    \ of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it\
    \ free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\
    \ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\
    \ ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following\
    \ notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source\
    \ file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\
    \ have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice\
    \ is found.\n\n<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\

    \nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to\nallow users\
    \ to freely share, modify, and use this Database while\nmaintaining this same\
    \ freedom for others. Many databases are covered by\ncopyright, and therefore\
    \ this document licenses these rights. Some\njurisdictions, mainly in the European\
    \ Union, have specific rights that\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses\
    \ these rights, too. Finally,\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users\
    \ of this Database to\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\n\
    \nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\naudiovisual\
    \ material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\nand so the ODbL\
    \ only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\ncontents of the Database\
    \ individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\ntogether with another license for\
    \ the contents, if the contents have a\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers\
    \ all of the contents. If the\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights,\
    \ Licensors should\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the\
    \ individual\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.\n\n\
    Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered\
    \ by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrade mark over\
    \ the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the\
    \ contents), and so you are advised that you may\nhave to consult other documents\
    \ or clear other rights before doing\nactivities not covered by this License.\n\
    \n------\n\nThe Licensor (as defined below)\n\nand\n\nYou (as defined below)\n\
    \nagree as follows:\n\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\n\n\"Collective\
    \ Database\" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part\nof a collection\
    \ of independent databases in themselves that together are\nassembled into a collective\

    \ jurisdiction under Section 10.4.\n\n\"Derivative Database\" - Means a database\
    \ based upon the Database, and\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement,\
    \ modification, or any\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part\

    \ the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new\nDatabase.\n\n\"Extraction\"\
    \ - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a\nSubstantial part of\

    \ as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it\nin a different\
    \ mode or format.\n\n\"You\" - Means a Person exercising rights under this License\
    \ who has not\npreviously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\n\
    Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\nexercise\
    \ rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\nWords in the singular\
    \ include the plural and vice versa.\n\n### 2.0 What this License covers\n\n2.1.\
    \ Legal effect of this document. This License is:\n\n  a. A license of applicable\
    \ copyright and neighbouring rights;\n\n  b. A license of the Database Right;\
    \ and\n\n  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\n\n2.2 Legal\
    \ rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\nDatabase, including:\n\
    \n  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\n  The\
    \ copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\n  Database, but\
    \ does not cover the copyright over the Contents\n  independent of this Database.\
    \ See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\n  law varies between jurisdictions,\
    \ but is likely to cover: the Database\n  model or schema, which is the structure,\
    \ arrangement, and organisation\n  of the Database, and can also include the Database\
    \ tables and table\n  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field\
    \ names of\n  Contents stored in the Database;\n\n  b. Database Rights. Database\
    \ Rights only extend to the Extraction and\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a\
    \ Substantial part of the Contents.\n  Database Rights can apply even when there\
    \ is no copyright over the\n  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the\
    \ Contents are removed\n  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a\
    \ way that would\n  not infringe any applicable copyright; and\n\n  c. Contract.\
    \ This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\n  access to the Database.\
    \ In return you agree to certain conditions of\n  use on this access as outlined\
    \ in this License.\n\n2.3 Rights not covered.\n\n  a. This License does not apply\
    \ to computer programs used in the making\n  or operation of the Database;\n\n\
    \  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\n  Database;\
    \ and\n\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\n\
    \  Database.\n\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items\
    \ of\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\n\
    including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\nrights,\
    \ and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\nRights or in\
    \ contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\nFor example, if\
    \ used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\nLicense would not apply to\
    \ copyright over individual images, which could\nhave their own separate licenses,\
    \ or one single license covering all of\nthe rights over the images.\n\n### 3.0\
    \ Rights granted\n\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the\
    \ Licensor\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable\
    \ (but\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\n\
    any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\ninclude\
    \ commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\nthe extent possible\
    \ in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\nexercised in all media and\
    \ formats whether now known or created in the\nfuture.\n\nThe rights granted cover,\
    \ for example:\n\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial\
    \ part of\n  the Contents;\n\n  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\n\n  c. Creation\
    \ of Collective Databases;\n\n  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions\
    \ by any means and\n  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\n\
    \  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\n\n  e. Distribution, communication,\
    \ display, lending, making available, or\n  performance to the public by any means\
    \ and in any form, in whole or in\n  part, including of any Derivative Database\
    \ or as a part of Collective\n  Databases.\n\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes.\
    \ For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes.\
    \ In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any\
    \ statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\n\
    \  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n  of\
    \ the rights granted under this License;\n\n  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes.\
    \ In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any\
    \ statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives\
    \ the\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\n\
    \  the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n  c. Voluntary license schemes.\
    \ The Licensor waives the right to collect\n  royalties, whether individually\
    \ or, in the event that the Licensor is\n  a member of a collecting society that\
    \ administers voluntary licensing\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise\
    \ by You of the rights\n  granted under this License.\n\n3.3 The right to release\
    \ the Database under different terms, or to stop\ndistributing or making available\
    \ the Database, is reserved. Note that\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed,\
    \ and so You may have the choice\nof using alternative licenses for this Database.\
    \ Subject to Section\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor\
    \ are reserved.\n\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use\n\n4.1 The rights granted in Section\
    \ 3 above are expressly made subject to\nYour complying with the following conditions\
    \ of use. These are important\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to\
    \ follow them, You will be\nin material breach of its terms.\n\n4.2 Notices. If\
    \ You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database\
    \ as part of a Collective Database, then You\nmust:\n\n  a. Do so only under the\
    \ terms of this License or another license\n  permitted under Section 4.4;\n\n\
    \  b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license\n  permitted\
    \ under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n  with the Database\
    \ or Derivative Database, including both in the\n  Database or Derivative Database\
    \ and in any relevant documentation; and\n\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or\
    \ Database Right notices and notices\n  that refer to this License.\n\n  d. If\
    \ it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\n  file due to\
    \ its structure, then You must include the notices in a\n  location (such as a\
    \ relevant directory) where users would be likely to\n  look for it.\n\n4.3 Notice\
    \ for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\nWork does not require\
    \ the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You\
    \ must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated\
    \ to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise\
    \ exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database,\
    \ Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and\
    \ that it\nis available under this License.\n\n  a. Example notice. The following\
    \ text will satisfy notice under\n  Section 4.3:\n\n        Contains information\
    \ from DATABASE NAME, which is made available\n        here under the Open Database\
    \ License (ODbL).\n\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database\
    \ and a\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. \"Open Database License\" should\n\
    contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\nhyperlinks are\
    \ not possible, You should include the plain text of the\nrequired URI's with\
    \ the above notice.\n\n4.4 Share alike.\n\n  a. Any Derivative Database that You\
    \ Publicly Use must be only under\n  the terms of:\n\n    i. This License;\n\n\
    \    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this\n      License;\
    \ or\n\n    iii. A compatible license.\n\n  If You license the Derivative Database\
    \ under one of the licenses\n  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms\
    \ of that license.\n\n  b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation\
    \ of the\n  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is\
    \ a\n  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.\n\n  c. Derivative\
    \ Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is\n  Publicly Used and\
    \ so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work\n  created from the Derivative\
    \ Database is Publicly Used.\n\n  d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For\
    \ the avoidance of doubt,\n  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases\
    \ under Section 4.4 a\n  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this\
    \ License.\n\n  e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine\n\
    \  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the\n  authorised\
    \ proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible\n  license grants You\
    \ permission to use the compatible license.\n\n\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The\
    \ requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply\nin the following:\n\n  a. For the\
    \ avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license\n  Collective Databases\
    \ under this License if You incorporate this\n  Database or a Derivative Database\
    \ in the collection, but this License\n  still applies to this Database or a Derivative\
    \ Database as a part of\n  the Collective Database;\n\n  b. Using this Database,\
    \ a Derivative Database, or this Database as\n  part of a Collective Database\
    \ to create a Produced Work does not\n  create a Derivative Database for purposes\
    \ of  Section 4.4; and\n\n  c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within\
    \ an organisation is\n  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the\
    \ requirements\n  of Section 4.4.\n\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You\
    \ Publicly Use a Derivative\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database,\
    \ You must also\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work\
    \ a copy\nin a machine readable form of:\n\n  a. The entire Derivative Database;\
    \ or\n\n  b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or\n\
    \  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an\n  algorithm),\
    \ including any additional Contents, that make up all the\n  differences between\
    \ the Database and the Derivative Database.\n\nThe Derivative Database (under\
    \ a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be\navailable at no more than a reasonable\
    \ production cost for physical\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed\
    \ over the internet.\n\n4.7 Technological measures and additional terms\n\n  a.\
    \ This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to\n  Section 4.7\
    \ b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the\n  Database, a Derivative\
    \ Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents that alter or\
    \ restrict the terms of this License, or any\n  rights granted under it, or have\
    \ the effect or intent of restricting\n  the ability of any person to exercise\
    \ those rights.\n\n  b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological\n\
    \  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a\n  Substantial\
    \ part of the Contents (a \"Restricted Database\") in\n  contravention of Section\
    \ 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the\n  Database or a Derivative Database\
    \ available to the recipient of the\n  Restricted Database:\n\n    i. That is\
    \ available without additional fee;\n\n    ii. That is available in a medium that\
    \ does not alter or restrict\n    the terms of this License, or any rights granted\
    \ under it, or have\n    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any\
    \ person to\n    exercise those rights (an \"Unrestricted Database\"); and\n\n\
    \    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the\n    recipient\
    \ as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.\n\n  c. For the avoidance\
    \ of doubt, You may place this Database or a\n  Derivative Database in an authenticated\
    \ environment, behind a\n  password, or within a similar access control scheme\
    \ provided that You\n  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any\
    \ rights\n  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the\n\
    \  ability of any person to exercise those rights.\n\n4.8 Licensing of others.\
    \ You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\nYou communicate the Database,\
    \ the whole or Substantial part of the\nContents, or any Derivative Database to\
    \ anyone else in any way, the\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the\
    \ Database on the same\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible\
    \ for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\n\
    enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\nsolely responsible\
    \ for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\nby You or another Person\
    \ at Your direction. You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the exercise\
    \ of the rights granted or affirmed\nunder this License.\n\n### 5.0 Moral rights\n\
    \n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\nto\
    \ be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\nthat\
    \ would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\nany other\
    \ derogatory treatment:\n\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights,\
    \ Licensor waives\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to\
    \ the fullest\n  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\
    \ Section\n  10.4;\n\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the\
    \ relevant\n  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any\
    \ moral\n  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\n\

    \  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\n\nPlease note that some\
    \ jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\nrights, and so moral rights\

    \ dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected\n\n6.1 This License\
    \ does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently have under\

    \ over the\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction\
    \ or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount\n\
    to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\nContents.\n\n\

    \ accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of\nerrors, fitness for a\
    \ particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.\nSome jurisdictions do not\

    \ to You.\n\n### 8.0 Limitation of liability\n\n8.1 Subject to any liability that\
    \ may not be excluded or limited by law,\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and\

    \ is caused by proved negligence on\nthe part of the Licensor.\n\n### 9.0 Termination\
    \ of Your rights under this License\n\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and\
    \ conditions of this License\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate\
    \ effect and without\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have\

    \ License.\n\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor\n\
    will not terminate Your rights under it.\n\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section\
    \ 9.1, this License is granted to You\nfor the duration of applicable rights in\

    \ terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect\
    \ unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n### 10.0 General\n\n10.1 If any provision\
