    \ COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\n    LEGAL SERVICES.\

    \ OR WORKS\n    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING\
    \ FROM\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\n  \
    \  HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout\
    \ the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined\
    \ below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\"\
    ) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\n\
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe\
    \ purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works\
    \ (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims\
    \ of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute\
    \ as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including\
    \ without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the\
    \ Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of\
    \ creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution\
    \ for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these\
    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly\
    \ distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of\
    \ CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available\
    \ under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"\
    Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\
    \ not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,\
    \ perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights\
    \ retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and\
    \ privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in\
    \ a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n\
    \     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting\
    \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi.\
    \ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n    \
    \ European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection\
    \ of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including\
    \ any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar,\
    \ equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable\
    \ law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver.\
    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including\
    \ existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\
    \ all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\n\
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding\
    \ without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"\
    Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public\
    \ at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending\
    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\
    \ termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment\
    \ of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of\
    \ Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\
    \ reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then\
    \ the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the\
    \ Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free,\
    \ non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional\
    \ license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i)\
    \ in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future\
    \ medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including\
    \ without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"\
    License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied\
    \ by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged\
    \ legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity\
    \ or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in\
    \ such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any\
    \ of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert\
    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\
    \ and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\
    \ abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\
    \ b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties\
    \ of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise,\
    \ including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness\
    \ for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or\
    \ other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
    \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
    \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\
    \ disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions\
    \ or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands\
    \ and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document\
    \ and has no duty or obligation with respect to\n    this CC0 or use of the Work."
