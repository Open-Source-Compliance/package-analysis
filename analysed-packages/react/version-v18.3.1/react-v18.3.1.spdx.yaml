    \      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n \
    \     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted\

    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\

    \ the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\
    \ derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection\

    \ avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram,\

    \ subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason\
    \ of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual\
    \ creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form\
    \ along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent\
    \ works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A\
    \ work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as\
    \ defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n     c. \"Distribute\" means\

    \ as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n     d. \"Licensor\"\

    \ singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\
    \ play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions\
    \ of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or\
    \ legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\
    \ (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\
    \n     f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\

    \ broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected\
    \ as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer\
    \ to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n\
    \     g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\
    \ who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\
    \ Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights\
    \ under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n     h. \"Publicly Perform\"\
    \ means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public\
    \ those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless\
    \ means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works\

    \ License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright\

    \n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\
    \ hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\
    \ duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the\
    \ Work as stated below:\n\n     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work\
    \ into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\
    \ Collections;\n\n     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any\
    \ such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps\
    \ to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to\
    \ the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original\
    \ work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate\
    \ \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n     c. to Distribute and Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n     d. to\
    \ Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n     e. For the avoidance of\
    \ doubt:\n\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\
    \ in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\
    \ licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right\
    \ to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under\
    \ this License;\n\n          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\
    \ jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory\
    \ or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive\
    \ right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\
    \ under this License; and,\n\n          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor\
    \ waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event\
    \ that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\
    \ licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\
    \ granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media\
    \ and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include\
    \ the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise\
    \ the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not\
    \ expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license\
    \ granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following\
    \ restrictions:\n\n     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only\
    \ under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\
    \ Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\
    \ Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\
    \ Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient\
    \ of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms\
    \ of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices\
    \ that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy\
    \ of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on\
    \ the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise\
    \ the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section\
    \ 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not\
    \ require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the\
    \ terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor\
    \ You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\
    \ required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice\
    \ from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation\
    \ any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n     b. If You Distribute,\
    \ or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless\
    \ a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\
    \ notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are\
    \ utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)\
    \ if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another\
    \ party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\
    \ attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms\
    \ of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;\
    \ (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,\
    \ the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\
    \ such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for\
    \ the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\
    \ a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation\
    \ of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by\
    \ Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented\
    \ in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation\
    \ or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\
    \ authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits\
    \ and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\
    \ authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by\
    \ this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,\
    \ by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\
    \ assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\
    \ Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\
    \ use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the\
    \ Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n     c. Except as otherwise\
    \ agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable\
    \ law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\
    \ or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,\
    \ modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\
    \ prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that\
    \ in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted\
    \ in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed\
    \ to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial\
    \ to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not\
    \ assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\
    \ applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\
    \ Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\
    \n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED\
    \ TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS\
    \ OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR\
    \ OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\
    \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT\
    \ OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR\
    \ NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,\
    \ SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT\
    \ TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE\
    \ TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\
    \ OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN\
    \ IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\
    \n     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\
    \ upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\
    \ who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities\
    \ remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\
    \ will survive any termination of this License.\n\n     b. Subject to the above\
    \ terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\
    \ of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor\
    \ reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop\
    \ distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election\
    \ will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,\
    \ or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License\
    \ will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n\
    8. Miscellaneous\n\n     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work\
    \ or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\
    \ on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\
    \n     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\
    \ offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\
    \ conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     c. If any\
    \ provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,\
    \ it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms\
    \ of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\
    \ such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
    \ provision valid and enforceable.\n\n     d. No term or provision of this License\
    \ shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent\
    \ shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\
    \ consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\
    \ respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or\
    \ representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall\
    \ not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication\
    \ from You.\n\n     e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\
    \ agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n     f. The rights granted under, and\
    \ the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology\
    \ of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\
    \ amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\
    \ Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the\
    \ Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and\
    \ subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License\
    \ terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of\
    \ the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\
    \ If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes\
    \ additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are\
    \ deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict\
    \ the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\

    \ a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders\
    \ may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to\
    \ copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The\

    \ licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission\
    \ to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other\
    \ rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the\
    \ terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors\
    \ should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that\
    \ the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark\
    \ any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material,\
    \ or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations\
    \ for licensors.\n\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public\
    \ licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material\
    \ under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary\
    \ for any reason-for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation\
    \ to copyright-then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant\
    \ only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has\
    \ authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\
    \ other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the\
    \ material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes\
    \ be marked or described.\n\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged\
    \ to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\

    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be\
    \ bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike\
    \ 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public\

    \ making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\

    \ Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed\
    \ Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,\

    \ Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public\
    \ License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound\

    \ synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n     b.\tAdapter's License\

    \ to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public\

    \ rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\
    \n     e.\tEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\
    \ absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations\
    \ under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,\
    \ and/or similar international agreements.\n\n     f.\tExceptions and Limitations\

    \ this Public License.\n\n     i.\tLicensed Rights means the rights granted to\

    \ individually chosen by them.\n\n     l.\tSui Generis Database Rights means rights\
    \ other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament\

    \ in the world.\n\n     m.\tYou means the individual or entity exercising the\
    \ Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\
    \nSection 2 - Scope.\n\n     a.\tLicense grant.\n\n          1. Subject to the\
    \ terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You\
    \ a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license\
    \ to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n           \
    \    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n\n\
    \               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       \
    \   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions\
    \ and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You\
    \ do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n          3. Term. The\
    \ term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n          4. Media\
    \ and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to\
    \ exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter\
    \ created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor\
    \ waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from\
    \ making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\
    \ technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.\
    \ For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized\
    \ by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n          5. Downstream\
    \ recipients.\n\n               A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material.\
    \ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from\
    \ the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions\
    \ of this Public License.\n\n               B. Additional offer from the Licensor\
    \ - Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically\
    \ receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted\
    \ Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n      \
    \         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional\
    \ or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures\
    \ to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights\
    \ by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n          6. No endorsement. Nothing\
    \ in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert\
    \ or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\
    \ with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or\
    \ others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\
    \n     b.\tOther rights.\n\n          1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity,\
    \ are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or\
    \ other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor\
    \ waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the\
    \ limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not\
    \ otherwise.\n\n          2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under\
    \ this Public License.\n\n          3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives\
    \ any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights,\
    \ whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable\
    \ statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\
    \ reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\nSection 3 - License Conditions.\n\
    \nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following\
    \ conditions.\n\n     a.\tAttribution.\n\n          1. If You Share the Licensed\
    \ Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n               A. retain\

    \n                    i.\tidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material\
    \ and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested\
    \ by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n                \
    \    ii.\ta copyright notice;\n\n                    iii. a notice that refers\
    \ to this Public License;\n\n                    iv.\ta notice that refers to\
    \ the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n                    v.\ta URI or hyperlink\
    \ to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n         \
    \      B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication\
    \ of any previous modifications; and\n\n               C. indicate the Licensed\
    \ Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or\
    \ the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n          2. You may satisfy\
    \ the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,\
    \ means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it\
    \ may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink\
    \ to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n          3. If requested\
    \ by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section\
    \ 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n     b.\tShareAlike.In addition\
    \ to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce,\
    \ the following conditions also apply.\n\n          1. The Adapter's License You\
    \ apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this\
    \ version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n          2. You must include\
    \ the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You\
    \ may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means,\
    \ and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n          3. You may not\
    \ offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply\
    \ any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise\
    \ of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\nSection 4 -\
    \ Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis\
    \ Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n     a.\t\
    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse,\
    \ reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n\
    \n     b.\tif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents\
    \ in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database\
    \ in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)\
    \ is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n     c.\t\
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial\
    \ portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section\
    \ 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License\
    \ where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection\
    \ 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n     a.\tUnless\
    \ otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the\
    \ Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations\
    \ or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express,\
    \ implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties\
    \ of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,\
    \ absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of\
    \ errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties\
    \ are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\n\
    \     b.\tTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You\
    \ on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise\
    \ for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,\
    \ or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License\
    \ or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the\
    \ possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation\
    \ of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply\
    \ to You.\n\n     c.\tThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,\
    \ most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\
    \nSection 6 - Term and Termination.\n\n     a.\tThis Public License applies for\
    \ the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You\
    \ fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public\
    \ License terminate automatically.\n\n     b.\tWhere Your right to use the Licensed\
    \ Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n          1. automatically\
    \ as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of\
    \ Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n          2. upon express reinstatement\
    \ by the Licensor.\n\n     c.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does\
    \ not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\
    \ of this Public License.\n\n     d.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor\
    \ may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\
    \ distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate\
    \ this Public License.\n\n     e.\tSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination\
    \ of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 - Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n     a.\t\
    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions\
    \ communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n     b.\tAny arrangements, understandings,\
    \ or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate\
    \ from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\
    Section 8 - Interpretation.\n\n     a.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public\
    \ License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict,\
    \ or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\
    \ be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent\
    \ possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it\
    \ shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\
    \ If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\
    \ without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\
    \n     c.\tNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure\

    \  HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout\
    \ the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined\
    \ below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\"\
    ) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\n\
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe\
    \ purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works\
    \ (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims\
    \ of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute\
    \ as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including\
    \ without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the\
    \ Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of\
    \ creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution\
    \ for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these\
    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly\
    \ distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of\
    \ CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available\
    \ under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"\
    Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\
    \ not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,\
    \ perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights\
    \ retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and\
    \ privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in\
    \ a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n\
    \     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting\
    \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi.\
    \ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n    \
    \ European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection\
    \ of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including\
    \ any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar,\
    \ equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable\
    \ law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver.\
    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including\
    \ existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\
    \ all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\n\
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding\
    \ without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"\
    Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public\
    \ at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending\
    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\
    \ termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment\
    \ of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of\
    \ Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\
    \ reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then\
    \ the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the\
    \ Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free,\
    \ non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional\
    \ license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i)\
    \ in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future\
    \ medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including\
    \ without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"\
    License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied\
    \ by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged\
    \ legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity\
    \ or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in\
    \ such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any\
    \ of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert\
    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\
    \ and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\
    \ abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\
    \ b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties\
    \ of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise,\
    \ including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness\
    \ for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or\
    \ other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
    \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
    \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\
    \ disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions\
    \ or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands\
    \ and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document\
