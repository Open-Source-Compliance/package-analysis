    \ CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1. Definitions.\n\n\
    \      \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\n\
    \      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\
    \n      \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n\

    \ shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\n      other entities that\
    \ control, are controlled by, or are under common\n      control with that entity.\
    \ For the purposes of this definition,\n      \"control\" means (i) the power,\
    \ direct or indirect, to cause the\n      direction or management of such entity,\
    \ whether by contract or\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\
    \ (50%) or more of the\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership\
    \ of such entity.\n\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal\
    \ Entity\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\n\n      \"Source\"\
    \ form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\n      including\

    \     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\"\
    \ shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based\
    \ on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions,\
    \ annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n      represent, as a whole,\

    \     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted\
    \ to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an\
    \ individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright\

    \ owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor\
    \ and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has\

    \n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n \
    \     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n     \
    \ worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright\

    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants\
    \ to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,\
    \ irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,\
    \ have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the\

    \      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s)\
    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which\
    \ such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation\
    \ against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\
    \ alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work\
    \ constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\
    \ licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
    \      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may\
    \ reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof\
    \ in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object\
    \ form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You\
    \ must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a\
    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\

    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\
    \ achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\
    \ change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     one\
    \ line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy\
    \ name of author\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it\
    \ and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published\

    \ option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that\
    \ it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\

    \nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n59 Temple Place, Suite\
    \ 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
    \nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n\
    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make\
    \ sure the software is free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies\
    \ to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program\
    \ whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software\
    \ is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply\
    \ it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n\
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free\
    \ programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights,\
    \ we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or\
    \ to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain\
    \ responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you\
    \ modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n\
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.\
    \ You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your\
    \ rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license\
    \ which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\
    \nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone\
    \ understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that\
    \ what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others\
    \ will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free\
    \ program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the\
    \ danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent\
    \ licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have\
    \ made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\
    \ licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\
    \ and\nmodification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\
    \ FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n\
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n\
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option\
    \ offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy\
    \ or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on\
    \ the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms\
    \ of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that\
    \ you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work\
    \ that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived\
    \ from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge\
    \ to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified\
    \ program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it,\
    \ when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to\
    \ print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice\
    \ and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n\
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.\
    \ But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work\
    \ based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole,\
    \ and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not\
    \ the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written\
    \ entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the\
    \ distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn\
    \ addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the\
    \ Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution\
    \ medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3.\
    \ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section\
    \ 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above\
    \ provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the\
    \ complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\
    \ software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for\
    \ at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n\
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto\
    \ distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\nallowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n\
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy\
    \ the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code,\
    \ even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the\
    \ object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n\
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy,\
    \ modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept\
    \ this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\
    \ and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe\
    \ Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or\
    \ any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license\
    \ from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject\
    \ to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions\
    \ on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence\
    \ of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\n\
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense\
    \ and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute\
    \ the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole\
    \ is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous\
    \ contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system\
    \ in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor\
    \ to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other\
    \ system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended\
    \ to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of\
    \ this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted\
    \ in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an\
    \ explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so\
    \ that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.\
    \ In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time. Such new\
    \ versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\
    \ detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing\
    \ version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which\
    \ applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the\
    \ terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published\
    \ by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\
    \ number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software\nFoundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program\
    \ into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write\
    \ to the author\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\
    \ Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n\
    make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n\
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR\
    \ AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n\
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software\
    \ which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach\
    \ the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start\
    \ of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and\

    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\
    \ to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <yyyy>\
    \ <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\

    \ your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.\
    \ But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work\
    \ based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole,\
    \ and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not\
    \ the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written\
    \ entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the\
    \ distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn\
    \ addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the\
    \ Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution\
    \ medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3.\
    \ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section\
    \ 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above\
    \ provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the\
    \ complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\
    \ software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for\
    \ at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n\
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto\
    \ distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\nallowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n\
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy\
    \ the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code,\
    \ even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the\
    \ object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n\
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy,\
    \ modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept\
    \ this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\
    \ and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe\
    \ Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or\
    \ any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license\
    \ from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject\
    \ to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions\
    \ on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence\
    \ of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\n\
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense\
    \ and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute\
    \ the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole\
    \ is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous\
    \ contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system\
    \ in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor\
    \ to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other\
    \ system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended\
    \ to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of\
    \ this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted\
    \ in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an\
    \ explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so\
    \ that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.\
    \ In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time. Such new\
    \ versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\
    \ detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing\
    \ version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which\
    \ applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the\
    \ terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published\
    \ by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\
    \ number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software\nFoundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program\
    \ into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write\
    \ to the author\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\
    \ Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n\
    make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n\
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR\
    \ AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n\
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software\
    \ which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach\
    \ the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start\
    \ of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and\
    \ each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where\
    \ the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief\
    \ idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program\
    \ is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms\
    \ of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation;\

    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the\
    \ Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n\
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps:\
    \ (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you\
    \ legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for\
    \ each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program\
    \ is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses,\
    \ in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it\
    \ clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed\
    \ at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\
    modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,\
    \ DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other\
    \ work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\
    \ distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\"\
    , below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\
    \nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is\
    \ to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or\
    \ with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation\
    \ is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee\
    \ is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and\
    \ modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The\
    \ act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n\
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n\
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option\
    \ offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy\
    \ or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on\
    \ the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms\
    \ of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that\
    \ you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work\
    \ that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived\
    \ from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge\
    \ to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified\
    \ program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it,\
    \ when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to\
    \ print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice\
    \ and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n\
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.\
    \ But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work\
    \ based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole,\
    \ and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not\
    \ the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written\
    \ entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the\
    \ distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn\
    \ addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the\
    \ Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution\
    \ medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3.\
    \ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section\
    \ 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above\
    \ provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the\
    \ complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\
    \ software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for\
    \ at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n\

    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of\

    \ applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the\
    \ terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published\
    \ by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\
    \ number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\

    \ the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start\
    \ of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and\
    \ each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where\

    \nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street,\
    \ Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\
    \ allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\
    \ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version\
    \ number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take\
    \ away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\
    \ Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\
    \ make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser\
    \ General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically\
    \ libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\
    \ it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\
    \ this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\
    \ use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak\
    \ of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software\
    \ and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\
    \ which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n \
    \  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared\
    \ so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\
    \ those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n   The \"Library\", below,\
    \ refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under\
    \ these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included\
    \ without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n   \"Source code\" for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules\
    \ it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\
    \ used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   Activities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is\
    \ not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\
    \ in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library\
    \ does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n   1. You may copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n   (For example,\
    \ a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely\
    \ well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires\
    \ that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be\
    \ optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must\
    \ still compute square roots.)\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\
    \ or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is\
    \ to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work\
    \ not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)\
    \ on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\
    \ under the scope of this License.\n\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of\
    \ the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy\
    \ of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\
    \ License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version\
    \ 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\
    \ if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n   Once this\
    \ change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works\
    \ made from that copy.\n\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part\
    \ of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n   4. You\
    \ may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   If distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n   5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n \
    \  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\
    \ an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\
    \ of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\
    \ is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\
    \ of such executables.\n\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material\
    \ from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work\
    \ may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\
    \ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without\
    \ the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be\
    \ true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n   If such an object file uses only\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros\
    \ and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\
    \ object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\
    \ work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\
    \ will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative\
    \ of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms\
    \ of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\
    \ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n   6. As\
    \ an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\
    \ the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\
    \ the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\
    \ engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n   You must give prominent\
    \ notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\
    \ Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\
    \ License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\
    \ the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing\
    \ the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\
    \n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\
    \ (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\
    \ an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"\
    work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\
    \ can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\
    \ the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents\
    \ of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile\
    \ the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n      b) Use a suitable\
    \ shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\
    \ is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\
    \ user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable,\
    \ and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the\
    \ user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with\
    \ the version that the work was made with.\n\n      c) Accompany the work with\
    \ a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials\
    \ specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing\
    \ this distribution.\n\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering\
    \ access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the\
    \ above specified materials from the same place.\n\n      e) Verify that the user\
    \ has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent\
    \ this user a copy.\n\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing\
    \ the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be\
    \ distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\
    \ source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\
    \ of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\
    \ itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   It may happen that this requirement\
    \ contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do\
    \ not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you\
    \ cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\
    \n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\
    \ side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\
    \ covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\
    \ the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\
    \ library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\
    \ things:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\
    \ based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b) Give prominent\
    \ notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based\
    \ on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form\
    \ of the same work.\n\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,\
    \ or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any\
    \ attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\
    \ Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\
    \ However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\
    \ compliance.\n\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you\
    \ have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\
    \ distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited\
    \ by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing\
    \ the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance\
    \ of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing\
    \ or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n   10. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with\
    \ or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose\
    \ any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\
    \ You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\
    \ License.\n\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\
    \ patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\
    \ your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then\
    \ as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if\
    \ a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Library.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held\
    \ invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\
    \ section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\
    \ in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce\
    \ you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
    \ of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity\
    \ of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license\
    \ practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\
    \ software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application\
    \ of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\
    \ to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\
    \ that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\
    \ believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n   12. If the distribution\
    \ and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents\
    \ or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\
    \ under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\
    \ excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\
    \ countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts\
    \ of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it\
    \ free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\
    \ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\
    \ ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following\
    \ notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source\
    \ file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\
    \ have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice\
    \ is found.\n\n<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\
    \nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis library is free software; you\
    \ can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\
    \ 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is\
    \ distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without\
    \ even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have\
    \ received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth\
    \ Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you\
    \ by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work\
    \ as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\"\
    \ for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne,\
    \ Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\n\nthe library `Frob' (a library\
    \ for tweaking knobs) written\n\nby James Random Hacker.\n\n< signature of Ty\
