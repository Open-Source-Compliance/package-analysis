    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which\
    \ such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation\
    \ against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\
    \ alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work\
    \ constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\
    \ licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
    \      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may\

    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\

    \nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\nCreative Commons public licenses provide\
    \ a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders\
    \ may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to\
    \ copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The\
    \ following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive,\
    \ and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public\
    \ licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission\
    \ to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other\
    \ rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the\
    \ terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors\
    \ should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that\
    \ the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark\
    \ any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material,\
    \ or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations\
    \ for licensors.\n\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public\
    \ licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material\
    \ under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary\
    \ for any reason-for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation\
    \ to copyright-then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant\
    \ only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has\
    \ authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\
    \ other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the\
    \ material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes\
    \ be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged\
    \ to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\
    \nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\nBy exercising\
    \ the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the\
    \ terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\
    \ Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be\
    \ interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration\
    \ of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\
    \ such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\
    \ Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\nSection 1 -\
    \ Definitions.\n\n     a.\tAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright\
    \ and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\
    \ and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed,\
    \ or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and\
    \ Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where\
    \ the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted\
    \ Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed\
    \ relation with a moving image.\n\n     b.\tAdapter's License means the license\
    \ You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted\
    \ Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\
    \n     c.\tCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\
    \ closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,\
    \ sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the\
    \ rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the\
    \ rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\
    \n     d.\tEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\
    \ absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations\
    \ under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,\
    \ and/or similar international agreements.\n\n     e.\tExceptions and Limitations\
    \ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright\
    \ and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  \
    \   f.\tLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other\
    \ material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\n     g.\tLicensed\
    \ Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of\

    \ to license.\n\n     h.\tLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting\
    \ rights under this Public License.\n\n     i.\tShare means to provide material\
    \ to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed\
    \ Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\
    \ dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available\
    \ to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material\

    \ Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC\

    \ equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n     k.\tYou means the individual\
    \ or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has\
    \ a corresponding meaning.\n\nSection 2 - Scope.\n\n     a.\tLicense grant.\n\n\
    \          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the\
    \ Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,\
    \ irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material\
    \ to:\n\n               A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole\
    \ or in part; and\n\n               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\
    \n          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions\
    \ and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You\
    \ do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n          3. Term. The\
    \ term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n          4. Media\
    \ and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to\
    \ exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter\
    \ created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor\
    \ waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from\
    \ making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\
    \ technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.\
    \ For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized\
    \ by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n          5. Downstream\
    \ recipients.\n\n               A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material.\
    \ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from\
    \ the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions\
    \ of this Public License.\n\n               B. No downstream restrictions. You\
    \ may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on,\
    \ or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing\
    \ so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\
    \ Material.\n\n          6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes\
    \ or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your\
    \ use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or\
    \ granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution\
    \ as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. Other rights.\n\n          1. Moral\
    \ rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License,\
    \ nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,\
    \ to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any\
    \ such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You\
    \ to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n          2. Patent and\
    \ trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n          3.\
    \ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from\
    \ You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting\
    \ society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.\
    \ In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such\
    \ royalties.\n\nSection 3 - License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed\
    \ Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n     a.\tAttribution.\n\
    \n          1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),\
    \ You must:\n\n               A. retain the following if it is supplied by the\
    \ Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n                    i. identification\
    \ of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive\
    \ attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by\
    \ pseudonym if designated);\n\n                    ii. a copyright notice;\n\n\
    \                    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n   \
    \                 iv.\ta notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\
    \n                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent\
    \ reasonably practicable;\n\n               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed\
    \ Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n   \
    \            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,\
    \ and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n\
    \          2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable\
    \ manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed\
    \ Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing\
    \ a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n\
    \          3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information\
    \ required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n   \
    \       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You\
    \ apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with\

    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\
    \ achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\
    \ change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     one\
    \ line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy\
    \ name of author\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it\
    \ and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\
    \ option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that\
    \ it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\
    \ of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General\
    \ Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of\
    \ the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the\
    \ Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\
    \ 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     Gnomovision version\
    \ 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby\
    \ disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes\
    \ at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\

    \nYou will indemnify and hold Shutterstock, its officers, employees, shareholders,\
    \ directors, managers, members and suppliers, harmless against any damages or\
    \ liability of any kind arising from any use of the Visual Content other than\
    \ the uses expressly permitted by this TOS. You further agree to indemnify Shutterstock\
    \ for all costs and expenses that Shutterstock incurs in the event that you breach\
    \ any of the terms of this or any other agreement with Shutterstock.\nPART V -\
    \ ADDITIONAL TERMS\nExcept when required by law, Shutterstock shall be under no\
    \ obligation to issue refunds under any circumstances. All fees are non-refundable,\
    \ even if your subscription is terminated before its expiration. You authorize\
    \ Shutterstock to charge you all subscription fees for the duration of the term\
    \ agreed to at the time of purchase. In the event that Shutterstock determines\
    \ that you are entitled to a refund of all or part of the fees you paid, such\
    \ refund shall be made using the payment method originally used by you to make\
    \ your purchase. If you reside in the European Union and you cancel your account\
    \ within fourteen (14) days of making payment to Shutterstock, provided that you\
    \ have not yet downloaded or licensed any Visual Content, Shutterstock, will refund\
    \ the payment made by you in connection with such cancelled account. To cancel\
    \ your account, please contact Customer Service. (Phone: Inside US 1-866-663-3954,\
    \ Outside US 1-646-419-4452 Email: Customer Support).\nFollowing the expiration\
    \ of your subscription plan, such plan will automatically renew on the same terms\
    \ as your original plan purchase. You can disable automatic renewal at any time\
    \ prior to renewal using your account settings. You expressly grant Shutterstock\
    \ the right to charge you for each automatic renewal until you timely disable\
    \ automatic renewal.\nThe fees charged by Shutterstock are exclusive of taxes,\
    \ and all such taxes, direct or indirect, shall be in addition to any fees related\
    \ to the products you are buying. If Shutterstock is required to collect indirect\
    \ and/or transactional taxes (such as sales tax, value-added tax, goods and services\
    \ tax, et al) under the laws of your state or country of residence, you shall\
    \ be liable for payment of any such indirect tax. Where Shutterstock or you are\
    \ required to collect or remit direct or indirect taxes, you may be required to\
    \ self-assess said tax under the applicable laws of your country of residence.\n\
    \"Non-transferable\" as used herein means that except as specifically provided\
    \ in this TOS, you may not sell, rent, load, give, sublicense, or otherwise transfer\
    \ to anyone, Content or the right to use Content. You may however, make a one-time\
    \ transfer of Content to a third party for the sole purpose of causing such third\
    \ party to print and/or manufacture your goods incorporating Content subject to\
    \ the terms and conditions herein. If you become aware that any social media website\
    \ uses any Content in a manner that exceeds your license hereunder, you agree\
    \ to remove all derivative works incorporating Content from such Social Media\
    \ Site, and to promptly notify Shutterstock of each such social media website's\
    \ use. You agree to take all commercially reasonable steps to prevent third parties\
    \ from duplicating any Content. If you become aware of any unauthorized duplication\
    \ of any Content please contact Customer Service. (Phone: Inside US 1-866-663-3954,\
    \ Outside US 1-646-419-4452 Email: Customer Support).\nUpon notice from Shutterstock\
    \ or if you learn that any Content is subject to a threatened or actual claim\
    \ of infringement, violation of another right, or any other claim for which Shutterstock\
    \ may be liable, or if Shutterstock removes any Content due to perceived business\
    \ risk as determined in Shutterstock's reasonable discretion and gives you notice\
    \ of such removal, you will remove the Content from your computer systems and\
    \ storage devices (electronic or physical) and, if possible, cease any future\
    \ use of the removed Content at your own expense. Shutterstock shall provide you\
    \ with comparable Content (which comparability will be determined by Shutterstock\
    \ in its reasonable commercial judgment) free of charge, but subject to the terms\
    \ and conditions of this TOS.\nIf you use any Content as part of work product\
    \ created for or delivered to a client or customer, you will disclose the identities\
    \ of such clients or customers to Shutterstock, upon Shutterstock’s reasonable\
    \ request.\nArbitration.\nAny controversy or claim arising out of or relating\
    \ to this TOS, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding individual (not\
    \ class) arbitration administered under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the\
    \ American Arbitration Association or of the International Centre for Dispute\
    \ Resolution in effect on the date of the commencement of arbitration, rather\
    \ than in court, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be\
    \ entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over\
    \ the relevant party or its assets. The place of arbitration shall be the state\
    \ and county of New York. The language of the arbitration shall be English. There\
    \ shall be one arbitrator to be mutually agreed by the parties. Each party shall\
    \ bear its own costs in the arbitration. Both parties agree that the following\
    \ claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a\
    \ judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) any claim related\
    \ to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’\
    s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property\
    \ rights; (ii) any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent\
    \ circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack)\
    \ (iii) any claim arising solely from Customer’s alleged failure to pay fees due\
    \ to Shutterstock. This arbitration provision will survive termination of this\
    \ TOS.\n\nYOU AND SHUTTERSTOCK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER\
    \ ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER\
    \ IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Shutterstock\
    \ agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims\
    \ or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\
    \ The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party\
    \ seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted\
    \ by that party’s individual claim. You and Shutterstock acknowledge and agree\
    \ that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable disputes\
    \ under this TOS.\n\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement\
    \ of any of the limitations in this Part V, Section 7 as to a particular claim\
    \ for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration\
    \ and may be brought in court.\n\nNeither party may assign this agreement, without\
    \ the prior written approval of the other party, except that Shutterstock may\
    \ assign this agreement to a subsidiary, an affiliated company within the Shutterstock\
    \ group, the entity that results from a merger or other corporate reorganization\
    \ involving Shutterstock, or an entity that acquires all or substantially all\
    \ of Shutterstock’s assets or capital stock.\nThis TOS shall be construed neither\
    \ against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning\
    \ of the language hereof. This TOS is governed by and shall be construed in accordance\
    \ with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction set forth in Section 5.24, without\
    \ respect to its conflict of laws principles.\nIf you are entering into this TOS\
    \ on behalf of your employer or other entity, you warrant and represent that you\
    \ have the full right and authority to do so. In the event that you do not have\
    \ such authority, you agree that you will be personally liable to Shutterstock\
    \ for any breaches of the terms of this TOS. You hereby grant Shutterstock a worldwide,\
    \ non-exclusive, limited license to use your trademarks in Shutterstock's promotional\
    \ materials, including a public customer list. Shutterstock's use of your trademarks\
    \ shall at all times conform to your then-current trademark use policies as made\
    \ available to Shutterstock and shall at all times inure to your benefit. Shutterstock\
    \ further agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate\
    \ any particular use of your trademark no later than thirty (30) days from the\
    \ date of receipt by Shutterstock of your email request to legal-notices@shutterstock.com.\n\
    The number of Content downloads available to you is determined by the product\
    \ you purchase. For the purposes of this TOS, a day is defined as the twenty four\
    \ (24) hour period beginning at the time your product is purchased. A month is\
    \ defined as a calendar month beginning on and including the date that you purchase\
    \ your product and ending on that date which is the earlier of (i) the same date\
    \ as your purchase in the following month or (ii) the last day of the following\
    \ month. By way of example, if you purchase a monthly subscription on March 5,\
    \ it will renew on April 5. If you purchase a monthly subscription on August 31,\
    \ your subscription will renew on September 30.\nUnless otherwise specified in\
    \ the coupon, any coupon or discount code applied to a purchase hereunder shall\
    \ apply only to the first payment made in connection with such purchase.\nIf any\
    \ individual term of this TOS is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any legal\
    \ or regulatory body of competent jurisdiction, such finding will be limited solely\
    \ to such invalid or unenforceable part, without affecting the remaining parts\
    \ of such individual term, or any other part of this TOS, so that this TOS shall\
    \ otherwise remain in full force and effect.\nYou expressly agree that any feedback\
    \ provided to you by Shutterstock or its representatives regarding any questions\
    \ you may have about this TOS or your use of Content licensed hereunder, is solely\
    \ for the purpose of interpreting this TOS and is not legal advice. Shutterstock\
    \ cannot render legal advice to you and expressly disclaims any liability of any\
    \ kind related to any feedback provided by Shutterstock or its representatives.\n\
    It is expressly understood and agreed that this TOS is entered into solely for\
    \ the mutual benefit of the parties herein and that no benefits, rights, duties,\
    \ or obligations are intended by this TOS as to third parties.\nIn the event that\
    \ you breach any of the terms of this or any other agreement with Shutterstock,\
    \ Shutterstock shall have the right to terminate your account without further\
    \ notice, in addition to Shutterstock's other rights at law and/or equity. Shutterstock\
    \ shall be under no obligation to refund any fees paid by you in the event that\
    \ your account is terminated by reason of a breach.\nExcept as expressly set forth\
    \ in the applicable license and warranties sections herein, Shutterstock grants\
    \ no rights and makes no further warranties. Shutterstock only has model or property\
    \ releases where expressly indicated on the Shutterstock website.\nShutterstock's\
    \ liability under any individual license purchased hereunder shall not exceed\
    \ the \"Limit of Liability\" applicable to the license in effect at the time you\
    \ know or should have known of the claim, and is without regard to the number\
    \ of times the subject Content is licensed or used by you.\nExcept as specifically\
    \ provided in Part IV hereof, in no event, will Shutterstock's total aggregate\
    \ liability to you or any third party claiming through you, arising out of or\
    \ in connection with your use of or inability to use the Shutterstock websites\
    \ and/or Content contained thereon (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) exceed\
    \ the monetary amount actually received by Shutterstock from you for the applicable\
    \ Content license.\nNeither Shutterstock nor any of its officers, employees, managers,\
    \ members, shareholders, directors or suppliers shall be liable to you or to any\
    \ other person or entity for any general, punitive, special, indirect, consequential\
    \ or incidental damages, or lost profits or any other damages, costs or losses\
    \ arising out of your use of the Content, Shutterstock's breach of this agreement,\
    \ or otherwise, unless expressly provided for herein, even if Shutterstock has\
    \ been advised of the possibility of such damages, costs or losses.\nExcept as\
    \ expressly set forth in Part III, all Content is provided \"as is\" without warranty\
    \ of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied\
    \ warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular\
    \ purpose. Some Content may contain elements that require additional clearance\
    \ if the Content is modified or used in a particular context. If you make such\
    \ modification or use Content in such context, you are solely responsible for\
    \ obtaining any additional clearances thereby required.\nShutterstock does not\
    \ warrant that the Content, Shutterstock websites, or other materials will meet\
    \ your requirements or that use will be uninterrupted or error free. The entire\
    \ risk as to the quality, performance and use of the Content is solely with you.\n\
    In the event that you use fraudulent credit card information to open an account\
    \ or otherwise engage in any criminal activity affecting Shutterstock, Shutterstock\
    \ will promptly file a complaint with www.ic3.gov, the internet crime complaint\
