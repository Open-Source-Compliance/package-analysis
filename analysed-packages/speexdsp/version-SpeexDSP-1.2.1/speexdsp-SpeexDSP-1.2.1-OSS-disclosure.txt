                        Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents
                                    Approved November 6, 2008
                               Effective Date: November 10, 2008
1. Background
The IETF Trust was formed on December 15, 2005, for, among other things, the
purpose
of acquiring, holding, maintaining and licensing certain existing and future
intellectual property
used in connection with the Internet standards process and its administration,
for the
advancement of science and technology associated with the Internet and related
technology.
Accordingly, pursuant to RFC 5378, Contributors to the IETF Standards Process
grant the IETF
Trust certain licenses with respect to their IETF Contributions. In RFC 5377,
the IETF
Community has provided the IETF Trust with guidance regarding licenses that the
IETF Trust
should grant to others with respect to such IETF Contributions and IETF
Documents. These
Legal Provisions describe the rights and licenses that the IETF Trust grants to
others with respect
to such IETF Contributions and IETF Documents; as well as certain restrictions,
limitations and
notices relating to IETF Documents. Capitalized terms used in these Legal
Provisions that are
not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in RFC 5378.
2. Applicability of these Legal Provisions.
a. These Legal Provisions are effective as of November 10, 2008 (the “Effective
Date”).
b. The licenses granted by the IETF Trust pursuant to these Legal Provisions
apply
only with respect to (i) IETF Contributions (including Internet-Drafts) that are
submitted to the
IETF following the Effective Date, and (ii) IETF RFCs and other IETF Documents
that are
published after the Effective Date.
c. IETF Contributions made, and IETF Documents published, prior to the Effective
Date (“Pre-Existing IETF Documents”) remain subject to the licensing provisions
of the IETF
copyright policy document in effect at the time of their publication, including
RFCs 1310, 1602,
2026, 3978 and 4748.
d. In most cases, rights to Pre-Existing IETF Documents that are not expressly
granted under these RFCs can only be obtained by requesting such rights directly
from the
document authors. The IETF Trust and the Internet Society do not become involved
in making
such requests to document authors.
e. These Legal Provisions may be amended from time to time by the IETF Trust in
a
manner consistent with the guidance provided by the IETF community and its own
operating
procedures. Any amendment to these Legal Provisions shall be posted for review
at
http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html and shall become effective on a
date specified
by the IETF Trust, but no earlier than thirty (30) days following its posting.
Such amendment
shall apply with respect to all IETF Contributions made and IETF Documents
published
following the effective date of such amendment. All prior versions of these
Legal Provisions
shall continue to be posted at http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html
for reference with
respect to IETF Contributions and IETF Documents as to which they may apply.
3. Licenses to IETF Documents and IETF Contributions.
a. License For Use Within the IETF Standards Process. The IETF Trust hereby
grants to each participant in the IETF Standards Process, to the greatest extent
that it is permitted
to do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all
copyrights and
rights of authors:
i. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF
Documents, in whole or in part, as part of the IETF Standards Process, and
ii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents, in whole or part,
into languages other than English as part of the IETF Standards Process, and
iii. unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained in an IETF
Contribution or IETF Document (as specified in Section 6.b below), to modify or
prepare
derivative works of such IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, in whole or in
part, as part of
the IETF Standards Process.
 b. IETF Standards Process. The term IETF Standards Process has the meaning
assigned to it in RFC 5378. In addition, the IETF Trust interprets the IETF
Standards Process to
include the archiving of IETF Documents in perpetuity for reference in support
of IETF activities
and the implementation of IETF standards and specifications.
 c. Licenses For Use Outside the IETF Standards Process. In addition to the
rights
granted with respect to Code Components described in Section 4 below, the IETF
Trust hereby
grants to each person who wishes to exercise such rights, to the greatest extent
that it is permitted
to do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all
copyrights and
rights of authors:
i. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF
Documents in full and without modification,
ii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents into languages other
than English, and to copy, publish, display and distribute such translated IETF
Contributions and
IETF Documents in full and without modification,
iii. to copy, publish, display and distribute unmodified portions of IETF
Contributions and IETF Documents and translations thereof, provided that:
(x) each such portion is clearly attributed to IETF and identifies the
RFC or other IETF Document or IETF Contribution from which it is taken, 
(y) all IETF legends, legal notices and indications of authorship
contained in the original IETF RFC must also be included where any substantial
portion of the
text of an IETF RFC, and in any event where more than one-fifth of such text, is
reproduced in a
single document or series of related documents.
 d. Licenses that are not Granted. The following licenses are not granted
pursuant to
these Legal Provisions:
i. any license to modify IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, or portions
thereof (other than to make translations or to extract, use and modify Code
Components as
permitted under the licenses granted under Section 4 of these Legal Provisions)
in any context
outside the IETF Standards Process, or
ii. any license to publish, display or distribute IETF Contributions or IETF
Documents, or portions thereof, without the required legends and notices
described in these
Legal Provisions.
 e. Requesting Additional Rights. Anyone who wishes to request license rights
from
the IETF Trust in addition to those granted under these Legal Provisions may
submit such
request to trustees@ietf.org. Such request will be considered by the IETF Trust,
which will
make a decision regarding the request in its sole discretion and inform the
requester of its
disposition. In addition, individual Contributors may be contacted regarding
licenses to their
IETF Contributions. The IETF Trust does not limit the ability of IETF
Contributors to license
their Contributions, so long as those licenses do not affect the rights granted
to the IETF Trust
under RFC 5378.
4. License to Code Components.
a. Definition. IETF Contributions and IETF Documents often include components
intended to be directly processed by a computer (“Code Components”). A list of
common Code
Components can be found at http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html .
b. Identification. Text in IETF Contributions and IETF Documents of the types
identified in Section 4.a above shall constitute “Code Components”. In addition,
any text found
between the markers <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS>, or otherwise clearly labeled
as a
Code Component, shall be considered a “Code Component”.
 c. License. In addition to the licenses granted under Section 3, Code
Components
are also licensed to each person who wishes to receive such a license on the
terms of the "BSD
License", as described below. If a licensee elects to apply the BSD License to a
Code
Component, then the additional licenses and restrictions set forth in Section 3
and elsewhere in
these Legal Provisions shall not apply thereto.

[insert RFC
number]. Please reproduce this note if possible.”) or any other reasonable
location.
5. License Limitations.
a. No Patent License. The licenses granted under these Legal Provisions shall
not be
deemed to grant any right under any patent, patent application or similar
intellectual property
right.
 b. Supersedure. The terms of any license granted under these Legal Provisions
may
be superseded by a written agreement between the IETF Trust and the licensee
that specifically
references and supersedes the relevant provisions of these Legal Provisions,
except that (i) the
IETF Trust shall in no event be authorized to grant rights with respect to any
Contribution in
excess of those which it has been granted by the Contributor, and (ii) the
rights granted shall not
be less than those otherwise granted under these Legal Provisions.
6. Text To Be Included in IETF Documents. The following text must be included on
the
first page of each IETF Document as specified below:
 a. Submission Compliance for Internet-Drafts. In each Internet-Draft: 
This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions
of BCP 78 and
BCP 79.
 b. Copyright and License Notice. In each IETF Document (including RFCs and
Internet-Drafts):
Copyright (c) [insert year] IETF Trust and the persons identified as the
document authors. All
rights reserved.
This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust’s Legal Provisions
Relating to IETF
Documents (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of
publication of this
document. Please review these documents carefully, as they describe your rights
and restrictions
with respect to this document.
 c. Derivative Works and Publication Limitations. If a Contributor desires to
limit
the right to make modifications and derivative works of an IETF Contribution, or
to limit its
publication, one of the following notices must be included. These notices may
not be used with
any standards-track document, nor with most working group documents.
i. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications, but does wish to
allow publication as an RFC:
This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be
created, except to
format it for publication as an RFC and to translate it into languages other
than English.
ii. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications nor to allow
publication as an RFC:
This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be
created, and it may not
be published except as an Internet-Draft.
7. Terms Applicable to All IETF Documents. The following legal terms apply to
all IETF
Documents:
a. All IETF Documents and the information contained therein are provided on an
"AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHE REPRESENTS
OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THE IETF TRUST AND
THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY THAT
THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY RIGHTS OR
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
b. The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to
the implementation
or use of the technology described in any IETF Document or the extent to which
any license
under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it
has made any
independent effort to identify any such rights. 
c. Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and
any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt
made to obtain a
general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by
implementers or users of
this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
http://www.ietf.org/ipr
.
d. The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
copyrights,
patents or patent applications, or other proprietary rights that may cover
technology that may be
required to implement any standard or specification contained in an IETF
Document. Please
address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
e. The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or under the
auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are published by third
parties,
including those that are translated into other languages, should not be
considered to be definitive
versions of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions is
that published
by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of these Legal Provisions that
are published by
third parties, including those that are translated into other languages, should
not be considered to
be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions.
f. For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards Process
licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of the IETF Standards
Process to the
IETF Trust pursuant to the provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary,
or terms,
conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the rights and
licenses granted under
RFC 5378, shall have any effect and shall be null and void, whether published or
posted by such
Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.

License-of-GNU-Licenses
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GFDL-1.1-no-invariants-or-later
GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.1, March 2000

Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,
Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is
not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed
by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of
the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a
portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated
into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-
Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose
contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic
text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any
title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all
copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in
covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts
on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must
also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying
in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each
Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the
Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has
access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at
least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role
of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified
Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things
in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that
of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there
were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the
same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives
permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as
the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the
public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License,
in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item
stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified
Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "History" in
the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations
given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed
in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the
section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each
of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text
and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part
of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title
with any Invariant Section.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but
endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in
the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover
Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the
Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by
you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that
you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the
original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
combined work in its license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into
the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding
verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the
Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate,
the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the
Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the
whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the original English
version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and
the original English version of this License, the original English version will
prevail.

9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free
Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:

Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with
the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is
included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead of
saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write "no
Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-
Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
