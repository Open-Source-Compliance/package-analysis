                    CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION
                    OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE
                    COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO
                    WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
                    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE
                    OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. Statement of
                    Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
                    exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
                    subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
                    and/or a database (each, a "Work"). Certain owners wish to permanently
                    relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons
                    of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can
                    reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify,
                    incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
                    form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
                    purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a
                    free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
                    works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
                    through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and
                    motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or
                    compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the
                    extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
                    voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
                    under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
                    the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. 1.
                    Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
                    by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
                    Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: i.
                    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
                    translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
                    performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image
                    or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition
                    in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v.
                    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
                    Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
                    of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any
                    amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar,
                    equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law
                    or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest
                    extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer
                    hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
                    abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
                    associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
                    existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all
                    territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law
                    or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
                    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
                    including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
                    (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the
                    public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully
                    intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission,
                    cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
                    quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
                    Statement of Purpose. 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver
                    for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
                    then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
                    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
                    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
                    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
                    and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
                    the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
                    provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
                    in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
                    purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
                    promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
                    of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
                    License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
                    law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the
                    remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
                    she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
                    Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
                    with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
                    Statement of Purpose. 4. Limitations and Disclaimers. a. No trademark or patent
                    rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or
                    otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes
                    no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express,
                    implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
                    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
                    the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of
                    errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible
                    under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights
                    of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
                    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
                    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
                    permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d. Affirmer
                    understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this
                    document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the
                    Work. </spdx:licenseText>

                    <endOptional>> Statement of Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout

                    below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
                    original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work"). Certain owners
                    wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of
                    contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons")
                    that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement
                    build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely
                    as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without
                    limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to
                    promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative,
                    cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
                    their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other
                    purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional
                    consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
                    "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related
                    Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly
                    distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
                    Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on
                    those rights.

                    CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION
                    OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE
                    COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO

                    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE
                    OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. Statement of
                    Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
                    exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
                    subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
                    and/or a database (each, a "Work"). Certain owners wish to permanently
                    relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons
                    of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can
                    reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify,
                    incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
                    form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
                    purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a
                    free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
                    works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
                    through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and
                    motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or
                    compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the
                    extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
                    voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
                    under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
                    the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. 1.
                    Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
                    by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
                    Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: i.
                    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
                    translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
                    performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image
                    or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition
                    in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v.
                    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
                    Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
                    of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any
                    amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar,
                    equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law
                    or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest
                    extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer
                    hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
                    abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
                    associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
                    existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all
                    territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law
                    or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
                    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
                    including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
                    (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the
                    public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully
                    intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission,
                    cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
                    quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
                    Statement of Purpose. 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver
                    for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
                    then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
                    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
                    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
                    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
                    and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
                    the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
                    provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
                    in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
                    purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
                    promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
                    of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
                    License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
                    law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the
                    remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
                    she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
                    Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
                    with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
                    Statement of Purpose. 4. Limitations and Disclaimers. a. No trademark or patent
                    rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or
                    otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes
                    no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express,
                    implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
                    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
                    the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of
                    errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible
                    under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights
                    of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
                    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
                    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
                    permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d. Affirmer
                    understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this
                    document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the
